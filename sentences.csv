1,a christmas carol in prose being a ghost story of christmas by charles dickens preface i have endeavoured in this ghostly little book to raise the ghost of an idea which shall not put my readers out of humour with themselves with each other with the season or with me
2,may it haunt their houses pleasantly and no one wish to lay it
3,their faithful friend and servant c d december 1843
4,contents stave i marleys ghost stave ii the first of the three spirits stave iii the second of the three spirits stave iv the last of the spirits stave v the end of it stave i marleys ghost marley was dead to begin with
5,there is no doubt whatever about that
6,the register of his burial was signed by the clergyman the clerk the undertaker and the chief mourner
7,scrooge signed it and scrooges name was good upon change for anything he chose to put his hand to
8,old marley was as dead as a doornail
9,mind i dont mean to say that i know of my own knowledge what there is particularly dead about a doornail
10,i might have been inclined myself to regard a coffinnail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade
11,but the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it or the countrys done for
12,you will therefore permit me to repeat emphatically that marley was as dead as a doornail
13,scrooge knew he was dead of course he did
14,how could it be otherwise scrooge and he were partners for i dont know how many years
15,scrooge was his sole executor his sole administrator his sole assign his sole residuary legatee his sole friend and sole mourner
16,and even scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain
17,the mention of marleys funeral brings me back to the point i started from
18,there is no doubt that marley was dead
19,this must be distinctly understood or nothing wonderful can come of the story i am going to relate
20,if we were not perfectly convinced that hamlets father died before the play began there would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a stroll at night in an easterly wind upon his own ramparts than there would be in any other middleaged gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy spotsay saint pauls churchyard for instance literally to astonish his sons weak mind
21,scrooge never painted out old marleys name
22,there it stood years afterwards above the warehouse door scrooge and marley the firm was known as scrooge and marley sometimes people new to the business called scrooge scrooge and sometimes marley but he answered to both names
23,it was all the same to him
24,oh but he was a tightfisted hand at the grindstone scrooge a squeezing wrenching grasping scraping clutching covetous old sinner hard and sharp as flint from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire secret and selfcontained and solitary as an oyster
25,the cold within him froze his old features nipped his pointed nose shrivelled his cheek stiffened his gait made his eyes red his thin lips blue and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice
26,a frosty rime was on his head and on his eyebrows and his wiry chin
27,he carried his own low temperature always about with him he iced his office in the dogdays and didnt thaw it one degree at christmas external heat and cold had little influence on scrooge no warmth could warm no wintry weather chill him
28,no wind that blew was bitterer than he no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose no pelting rain less open to entreaty
29,foul weather didnt know where to have him
30,the heaviest rain and snow and hail and sleet could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect
31,they often came down handsomely and scrooge never did
32,nobody ever stopped him in the street to say with gladsome looks my dear scrooge how are you when will you come to see me no beggars implored him to bestow a trifle no children asked him what it was oclock no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place of scrooge even the blind mens dogs appeared to know him and when they saw him coming on would tug their owners into doorways and up courts and then would wag their tails as though they said no eye at all is better than an evil eye dark master but what did scrooge care it was the very thing he liked
33,to edge his way along the crowded paths of life warning all human sympathy to keep its distance was what the knowing ones call nuts to scrooge once upon a timeof all the good days in the year on christmas eveold scrooge sat busy in his countinghouse
34,it was cold bleak biting weather foggy withal and he could hear the people in the court outside go wheezing up and down beating their hands upon their breasts and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them
35,the city clocks had only just gone three but it was quite dark already it had not been light all dayand candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring offices like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air
36,the fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole and was so dense without that although the court was of the narrowest the houses opposite were mere phantoms
37,to see the dingy cloud come drooping down obscuring everything one might have thought that nature lived hard by and was brewing on a large scale
38,the door of scrooges countinghouse was open that he might keep his eye upon his clerk who in a dismal little cell beyond a sort of tank was copying letters
39,scrooge had a very small fire but the clerks fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal
40,but he couldnt replenish it for scrooge kept the coalbox in his own room and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel the master predicted that it would be necessary for them to part
41,wherefore the clerk put on his white comforter and tried to warm himself at the candle in which effort not being a man of a strong imagination he failed
42,a merry christmas uncle god save you cried a cheerful voice
43,it was the voice of scrooges nephew who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach
44,bah said scrooge humbug he had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost this nephew of scrooges that he was all in a glow his face was ruddy and handsome his eyes sparkled and his breath smoked again
45,christmas a humbug uncle said scrooges nephew
46,you dont mean that i am sure i do said scrooge merry christmas what right have you to be merry what reason have you to be merry youre poor enough come then returned the nephew gaily
47,what right have you to be dismal what reason have you to be morose youre rich enough scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment said bah again and followed it up with humbug dont be cross uncle said the nephew
48,what else can i be returned the uncle when i live in such a world of fools as this merry christmas out upon merry christmas whats christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money a time for finding yourself a year older but not an hour richer a time for balancing your books and having every item in em through a round dozen of months presented dead against you if i could work my will said scrooge indignantly every idiot who goes about with merry christmas on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart
49,he should uncle pleaded the nephew
50,nephew returned the uncle sternly keep christmas in your own way and let me keep it in mine keep it repeated scrooges nephew
51,but you dont keep it let me leave it alone then said scrooge much good may it do you much good it has ever done you there are many things from which i might have derived good by which i have not profited i dare say returned the nephew
52,christmas among the rest
53,but i am sure i have always thought of christmas time when it has come roundapart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin if anything belonging to it can be apart from thatas a good time a kind forgiving charitable pleasant time the only time i know of in the long calendar of the year when men and women seem by one consent to open their shutup hearts freely and to think of people below them as if they really were fellowpassengers to the grave and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys
54,and therefore uncle though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket i believe that it has done me good and will do me good and i say god bless it the clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded
55,becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety he poked the fire and extinguished the last frail spark for ever
56,let me hear another sound from you said scrooge and youll keep your christmas by losing your situation youre quite a powerful speaker sir he added turning to his nephew
57,i wonder you dont go into parliament dont be angry uncle
58,come dine with us tomorrow scrooge said that he would see himyes indeed he did
59,he went the whole length of the expression and said that he would see him in that extremity first
60,but why cried scrooges nephew
61,why why did you get married said scrooge because i fell in love because you fell in love growled scrooge as if that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry christmas good afternoon nay uncle but you never came to see me before that happened
62,why give it as a reason for not coming now good afternoon said scrooge i want nothing from you i ask nothing of you why cannot we be friends good afternoon said scrooge i am sorry with all my heart to find you so resolute
63,we have never had any quarrel to which i have been a party
64,but i have made the trial in homage to christmas and ill keep my christmas humour to the last
65,so a merry christmas uncle good afternoon said scrooge and a happy new year good afternoon said scrooge his nephew left the room without an angry word notwithstanding
66,he stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk who cold as he was was warmer than scrooge for he returned them cordially
67,theres another fellow muttered scrooge who overheard him my clerk with fifteen shillings a week and a wife and family talking about a merry christmas ill retire to bedlam this lunatic in letting scrooges nephew out had let two other people in
68,they were portly gentlemen pleasant to behold and now stood with their hats off in scrooges office
69,they had books and papers in their hands and bowed to him
70,scrooge and marleys i believe said one of the gentlemen referring to his list
71,have i the pleasure of addressing mr scrooge or mr marley mr
72,marley has been dead these seven years scrooge replied
73,he died seven years ago this very night we have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner said the gentleman presenting his credentials
74,it certainly was for they had been two kindred spirits
75,at the ominous word liberality scrooge frowned and shook his head and handed the credentials back
76,at this festive season of the year mr scrooge said the gentleman taking up a pen it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the poor and destitute who suffer greatly at the present time
77,many thousands are in want of common necessaries hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts sir are there no prisons asked scrooge plenty of prisons said the gentleman laying down the pen again
78,and the union workhouses demanded scrooge are they still in operation they are
79,still returned the gentleman i wish i could say they were not the treadmill and the poor law are in full vigour then said scrooge both very busy sir oh i was afraid from what you said at first that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course said scrooge im very glad to hear it under the impression that they scarcely furnish christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude returned the gentleman a few of us are endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the poor some meat and drink and means of warmth
80,we choose this time because it is a time of all others when want is keenly felt and abundance rejoices
81,what shall i put you down for nothing scrooge replied
82,you wish to be anonymous i wish to be left alone said scrooge since you ask me what i wish gentlemen that is my answer
83,i dont make merry myself at christmas and i cant afford to make idle people merry
84,i help to support the establishments i have mentionedthey cost enough and those who are badly off must go there many cant go there and many would rather die if they would rather die said scrooge they had better do it and decrease the surplus population
85,besidesexcuse mei dont know that but you might know it observed the gentleman
86,its not my business scrooge returned
87,its enough for a man to understand his own business and not to interfere with other peoples
88,mine occupies me constantly
89,good afternoon gentlemen seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point the gentlemen withdrew
90,scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion of himself and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him
91,meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so that people ran about with flaring links proffering their services to go before horses in carriages and conduct them on their way
92,the ancient tower of a church whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down at scrooge out of a gothic window in the wall became invisible and struck the hours and quarters in the clouds with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there
93,the cold became intense
94,in the main street at the corner of the court some labourers were repairing the gaspipes and had lighted a great fire in a brazier round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered warming their hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture
95,the waterplug being left in solitude its overflowings sullenly congealed and turned to misanthropic ice
96,the brightness of the shops where holly sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows made pale faces ruddy as they passed
97,poulterers and grocers trades became a splendid joke a glorious pageant with which it was next to impossible to believe that such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do
98,the lord mayor in the stronghold of the mighty mansion house gave orders to his fifty cooks and butlers to keep christmas as a lord mayors household should and even the little tailor whom he had fined five shillings on the previous monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets stirred up tomorrows pudding in his garret while his lean wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef
99,foggier yet and colder
100,piercing searching biting cold
101,if the good saint dunstan had but nipped the evil spirits nose with a touch of such weather as that instead of using his familiar weapons then indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose
102,the owner of one scant young nose gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs stooped down at scrooges keyhole to regale him with a christmas carol but at the first sound of god bless you merry gentleman may nothing you dismay scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled in terror leaving the keyhole to the fog and even more congenial frost
103,at length the hour of shutting up the countinghouse arrived
104,with an illwill scrooge dismounted from his stool and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant clerk in the tank who instantly snuffed his candle out and put on his hat
105,youll want all day tomorrow i suppose said scrooge if quite convenient sir its not convenient said scrooge and its not fair
106,if i was to stop halfacrown for it youd think yourself illused ill be bound the clerk smiled faintly
107,and yet said scrooge you dont think me illused when i pay a days wages for no work the clerk observed that it was only once a year
108,a poor excuse for picking a mans pocket every twentyfifth of december said scrooge buttoning his greatcoat to the chin
109,but i suppose you must have the whole day
110,be here all the earlier next morning the clerk promised that he would and scrooge walked out with a growl
111,the office was closed in a twinkling and the clerk with the long ends of his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no greatcoat) went down a slide on cornhill at the end of a lane of boys twenty times in honour of its being christmas eve and then ran home to camden town as hard as he could pelt to play at blindmansbuff
112,scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern and having read all the newspapers and beguiled the rest of the evening with his bankersbook went home to bed
113,he lived in chambers which had once belonged to his deceased partner
114,they were a gloomy suite of rooms in a lowering pile of building up a yard where it had so little business to be that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run there when it was a young house playing at hideandseek with other houses and forgotten the way out again
115,it was old enough now and dreary enough for nobody lived in it but scrooge the other rooms being all let out as offices
116,the yard was so dark that even scrooge who knew its every stone was fain to grope with his hands
117,the fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house that it seemed as if the genius of the weather sat in mournful meditation on the threshold
118,now it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the knocker on the door except that it was very large
119,it is also a fact that scrooge had seen it night and morning during his whole residence in that place also that scrooge had as little of what is called fancy about him as any man in the city of london even includingwhich is a bold wordthe corporation aldermen and livery
120,let it also be borne in mind that scrooge had not bestowed one thought on marley since his last mention of his seven years dead partner that afternoon
121,and then let any man explain to me if he can how it happened that scrooge having his key in the lock of the door saw in the knocker without its undergoing any intermediate process of changenot a knocker but marleys face
122,marleys face
123,it was not in impenetrable shadow as the other objects in the yard were but had a dismal light about it like a bad lobster in a dark cellar
124,it was not angry or ferocious but looked at scrooge as marley used to look with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead
125,the hair was curiously stirred as if by breath or hot air and though the eyes were wide open they were perfectly motionless
126,that and its livid colour made it horrible but its horror seemed to be in spite of the face and beyond its control rather than a part of its own expression
127,as scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon it was a knocker again
128,to say that he was not startled or that his blood was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy would be untrue
129,but he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished turned it sturdily walked in and lighted his candle
130,he did pause with a moments irresolution before he shut the door and he did look cautiously behind it first as if he half expected to be terrified with the sight of marleys pigtail sticking out into the hall
131,but there was nothing on the back of the door except the screws and nuts that held the knocker on so he said pooh pooh and closed it with a bang
132,the sound resounded through the house like thunder
133,every room above and every cask in the winemerchants cellars below appeared to have a separate peal of echoes of its own
134,scrooge was not a man to be frightened by echoes
135,he fastened the door and walked across the hall and up the stairs slowly too trimming his candle as he went
136,you may talk vaguely about driving a coachandsix up a good old flight of stairs or through a bad young act of parliament but i mean to say you might have got a hearse up that staircase and taken it broadwise with the splinterbar towards the wall and the door towards the balustrades and done it easy
137,there was plenty of width for that and room to spare which is perhaps the reason why scrooge thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom
138,halfadozen gaslamps out of the street wouldnt have lighted the entry too well so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with scrooges dip
139,up scrooge went not caring a button for that
140,darkness is cheap and scrooge liked it
141,but before he shut his heavy door he walked through his rooms to see that all was right
142,he had just enough recollection of the face to desire to do that
143,sittingroom bedroom lumberroom
144,all as they should be
145,nobody under the table nobody under the sofa a small fire in the grate spoon and basin ready and the little saucepan of gruel (scrooge had a cold in his head) upon the hob
146,nobody under the bed nobody in the closet nobody in his dressinggown which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against the wall
147,lumberroom as usual
148,old fireguard old shoes two fishbaskets washingstand on three legs and a poker
149,quite satisfied he closed his door and locked himself in doublelocked himself in which was not his custom
150,thus secured against surprise he took off his cravat put on his dressinggown and slippers and his nightcap and sat down before the fire to take his gruel
151,it was a very low fire indeed nothing on such a bitter night
152,he was obliged to sit close to it and brood over it before he could extract the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel
153,the fireplace was an old one built by some dutch merchant long ago and paved all round with quaint dutch tiles designed to illustrate the scriptures there were cains and abels pharaohs daughters queens of sheba angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like featherbeds abrahams belshazzars apostles putting off to sea in butterboats hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts and yet that face of marley seven years dead came like the ancient prophets rod and swallowed up the whole
154,if each smooth tile had been a blank at first with power to shape some picture on its surface from the disjointed fragments of his thoughts there would have been a copy of old marleys head on every one
155,humbug said scrooge and walked across the room
156,after several turns he sat down again
157,as he threw his head back in the chair his glance happened to rest upon a bell a disused bell that hung in the room and communicated for some purpose now forgotten with a chamber in the highest story of the building
158,it was with great astonishment and with a strange inexplicable dread that as he looked he saw this bell begin to swing
159,it swung so softly in the outset that it scarcely made a sound but soon it rang out loudly and so did every bell in the house
160,this might have lasted half a minute or a minute but it seemed an hour
161,the bells ceased as they had begun together
162,they were succeeded by a clanking noise deep down below as if some person were dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the winemerchants cellar
163,scrooge then remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as dragging chains
164,the cellardoor flew open with a booming sound and then he heard the noise much louder on the floors below then coming up the stairs then coming straight towards his door
165,its humbug still said scrooge i wont believe it his colour changed though when without a pause it came on through the heavy door and passed into the room before his eyes
166,upon its coming in the dying flame leaped up as though it cried i know him marleys ghost and fell again
167,the same face the very same
168,marley in his pigtail usual waistcoat tights and boots the tassels on the latter bristling like his pigtail and his coatskirts and the hair upon his head
169,the chain he drew was clasped about his middle
170,it was long and wound about him like a tail and it was made (for scrooge observed it closely) of cashboxes keys padlocks ledgers deeds and heavy purses wrought in steel
171,his body was transparent so that scrooge observing him and looking through his waistcoat could see the two buttons on his coat behind
172,scrooge had often heard it said that marley had no bowels but he had never believed it until now
173,no nor did he believe it even now
174,though he looked the phantom through and through and saw it standing before him though he felt the chilling influence of its deathcold eyes and marked the very texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head and chin which wrapper he had not observed before he was still incredulous and fought against his senses
175,how now said scrooge caustic and cold as ever
176,what do you want with me muchmarleys voice no doubt about it
177,who are you ask me who i was who were you then said scrooge raising his voice
178,youre particular for a shade he was going to say to a shade but substituted this as more appropriate
179,in life i was your partner jacob marley can youcan you sit down asked scrooge looking doubtfully at him
180,i can do it then scrooge asked the question because he didnt know whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair and felt that in the event of its being impossible it might involve the necessity of an embarrassing explanation
181,but the ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace as if he were quite used to it
182,you dont believe in me observed the ghost i dont said scrooge what evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your senses i dont know said scrooge why do you doubt your senses because said scrooge a little thing affects them
183,a slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats
184,you may be an undigested bit of beef a blot of mustard a crumb of cheese a fragment of an underdone potato
185,theres more of gravy than of grave about you whatever you are scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes nor did he feel in his heart by any means waggish then
186,the truth is that he tried to be smart as a means of distracting his own attention and keeping down his terror for the spectres voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones
187,to sit staring at those fixed glazed eyes in silence for a moment would play scrooge felt the very deuce with him
188,there was something very awful too in the spectres being provided with an infernal atmosphere of its own
189,scrooge could not feel it himself but this was clearly the case for though the ghost sat perfectly motionless its hair and skirts and tassels were still agitated as by the hot vapour from an oven
190,you see this toothpick said scrooge returning quickly to the charge for the reason just assigned and wishing though it were only for a second to divert the visions stony gaze from himself
191,i do replied the ghost you are not looking at it said scrooge but i see it said the ghost notwithstanding well returned scrooge i have but to swallow this and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins all of my own creation
192,humbug i tell you humbug at this the spirit raised a frightful cry and shook its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise that scrooge held on tight to his chair to save himself from falling in a swoon
193,but how much greater was his horror when the phantom taking off the bandage round its head as if it were too warm to wear indoors its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast scrooge fell upon his knees and clasped his hands before his face
194,mercy he said
195,dreadful apparition why do you trouble me man of the worldly mind replied the ghost do you believe in me or not i do said scrooge i must
196,but why do spirits walk the earth and why do they come to me it is required of every man the ghost returned that the spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellowmen and travel far and wide and if that spirit goes not forth in life it is condemned to do so after death
197,it is doomed to wander through the worldoh woe is meand witness what it cannot share but might have shared on earth and turned to happiness again the spectre raised a cry and shook its chain and wrung its shadowy hands
198,you are fettered said scrooge trembling
199,tell me why i wear the chain i forged in life replied the ghost i made it link by link and yard by yard i girded it on of my own free will and of my own free will i wore it
200,is its pattern strange to you scrooge trembled more and more
201,or would you know pursued the ghost the weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself it was full as heavy and as long as this seven christmas eves ago
202,you have laboured on it since
203,it is a ponderous chain scrooge glanced about him on the floor in the expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable but he could see nothing
204,jacob he said imploringly
205,old jacob marley tell me more
206,speak comfort to me jacob i have none to give the ghost replied
207,it comes from other regions ebenezer scrooge and is conveyed by other ministers to other kinds of men
208,nor can i tell you what i would
209,a very little more is all permitted to me
210,i cannot rest i cannot stay i cannot linger anywhere
211,my spirit never walked beyond our countinghousemark mein life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our moneychanging hole and weary journeys lie before me it was a habit with scrooge whenever he became thoughtful to put his hands in his breeches pockets
212,pondering on what the ghost had said he did so now but without lifting up his eyes or getting off his knees
213,you must have been very slow about it jacob scrooge observed in a businesslike manner though with humility and deference
214,slow the ghost repeated
215,seven years dead mused scrooge and travelling all the time the whole time said the ghost no rest no peace
216,incessant torture of remorse you travel fast said scrooge on the wings of the wind replied the ghost you might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years said scrooge the ghost on hearing this set up another cry and clanked its chain so hideously in the dead silence of the night that the ward would have been justified in indicting it for a nuisance
217,oh captive bound and doubleironed cried the phantom not to know that ages of incessant labour by immortal creatures for this earth must pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is all developed
218,not to know that any christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere whatever it may be will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness
219,not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one lifes opportunity misused yet such was i oh such was i but you were always a good man of business jacob faltered scrooge who now began to apply this to himself
220,business cried the ghost wringing its hands again
221,mankind was my business
222,the common welfare was my business charity mercy forbearance and benevolence were all my business
223,the dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business it held up its chain at arms length as if that were the cause of all its unavailing grief and flung it heavily upon the ground again
224,at this time of the rolling year the spectre said i suffer most
225,why did i walk through crowds of fellowbeings with my eyes turned down and never raise them to that blessed star which led the wise men to a poor abode were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted me scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this rate and began to quake exceedingly
226,hear me cried the ghost my time is nearly gone i will said scrooge but dont be hard upon me dont be flowery jacob pray how it is that i appear before you in a shape that you can see i may not tell
227,i have sat invisible beside you many and many a day it was not an agreeable idea
228,scrooge shivered and wiped the perspiration from his brow
229,that is no light part of my penance pursued the ghost i am here tonight to warn you that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate
230,a chance and hope of my procuring ebenezer you were always a good friend to me said scrooge thankee you will be haunted resumed the ghost by three spirits scrooges countenance fell almost as low as the ghosts had done
231,is that the chance and hope you mentioned jacob he demanded in a faltering voice
232,it is ii think id rather not said scrooge without their visits said the ghost you cannot hope to shun the path i tread
233,expect the first tomorrow when the bell tolls one couldnt i take em all at once and have it over jacob hinted scrooge expect the second on the next night at the same hour
234,the third upon the next night when the last stroke of twelve has ceased to vibrate
235,look to see me no more and look that for your own sake you remember what has passed between us when it had said these words the spectre took its wrapper from the table and bound it round its head as before
236,scrooge knew this by the smart sound its teeth made when the jaws were brought together by the bandage
237,he ventured to raise his eyes again and found his supernatural visitor confronting him in an erect attitude with its chain wound over and about its arm
238,the apparition walked backward from him and at every step it took the window raised itself a little so that when the spectre reached it it was wide open
239,it beckoned scrooge to approach which he did
240,when they were within two paces of each other marleys ghost held up its hand warning him to come no nearer
241,scrooge stopped
242,not so much in obedience as in surprise and fear for on the raising of the hand he became sensible of confused noises in the air incoherent sounds of lamentation and regret wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and selfaccusatory
243,the spectre after listening for a moment joined in the mournful dirge and floated out upon the bleak dark night
244,scrooge followed to the window desperate in his curiosity
245,he looked out
246,the air was filled with phantoms wandering hither and thither in restless haste and moaning as they went
247,every one of them wore chains like marleys ghost some few (they might be guilty governments) were linked together none were free
248,many had been personally known to scrooge in their lives
249,he had been quite familiar with one old ghost in a white waistcoat with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an infant whom it saw below upon a doorstep
250,the misery with them all was clearly that they sought to interfere for good in human matters and had lost the power for ever
251,whether these creatures faded into mist or mist enshrouded them he could not tell
252,but they and their spirit voices faded together and the night became as it had been when he walked home
253,scrooge closed the window and examined the door by which the ghost had entered
254,it was doublelocked as he had locked it with his own hands and the bolts were undisturbed
255,he tried to say humbug but stopped at the first syllable
256,and being from the emotion he had undergone or the fatigues of the day or his glimpse of the invisible world or the dull conversation of the ghost or the lateness of the hour much in need of repose went straight to bed without undressing and fell asleep upon the instant
257,stave ii the first of the three spirits when scrooge awoke it was so dark that looking out of bed he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber
258,he was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters
259,so he listened for the hour
260,to his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from six to seven and from seven to eight and regularly up to twelve then stopped
261,twelve it was past two when he went to bed
262,the clock was wrong
263,an icicle must have got into the works
264,twelve he touched the spring of his repeater to correct this most preposterous clock
265,its rapid little pulse beat twelve and stopped
266,why it isnt possible said scrooge that i can have slept through a whole day and far into another night
267,it isnt possible that anything has happened to the sun and this is twelve at noon the idea being an alarming one he scrambled out of bed and groped his way to the window
268,he was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve of his dressinggown before he could see anything and could see very little then
269,all he could make out was that it was still very foggy and extremely cold and that there was no noise of people running to and fro and making a great stir as there unquestionably would have been if night had beaten off bright day and taken possession of the world
270,this was a great relief because three days after sight of this first of exchange pay to mr ebenezer scrooge or his order and so forth would have become a mere united states security if there were no days to count by
271,scrooge went to bed again and thought and thought and thought it over and over and over and could make nothing of it
272,the more he thought the more perplexed he was and the more he endeavoured not to think the more he thought
273,marleys ghost bothered him exceedingly
274,every time he resolved within himself after mature inquiry that it was all a dream his mind flew back again like a strong spring released to its first position and presented the same problem to be worked all through was it a dream or not scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters more when he remembered on a sudden that the ghost had warned him of a visitation when the bell tolled one
275,he resolved to lie awake until the hour was passed and considering that he could no more go to sleep than go to heaven this was perhaps the wisest resolution in his power
276,the quarter was so long that he was more than once convinced he must have sunk into a doze unconsciously and missed the clock
277,at length it broke upon his listening ear
278,ding dong a quarter past said scrooge counting
279,ding dong halfpast said scrooge ding dong a quarter to it said scrooge ding dong the hour itself said scrooge triumphantly and nothing else he spoke before the hour bell sounded which it now did with a deep dull hollow melancholy one light flashed up in the room upon the instant and the curtains of his bed were drawn
280,the curtains of his bed were drawn aside i tell you by a hand
281,not the curtains at his feet nor the curtains at his back but those to which his face was addressed
282,the curtains of his bed were drawn aside and scrooge starting up into a halfrecumbent attitude found himself face to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them as close to it as i am now to you and i am standing in the spirit at your elbow
283,it was a strange figurelike a child yet not so like a child as like an old man viewed through some supernatural medium which gave him the appearance of having receded from the view and being diminished to a childs proportions
284,its hair which hung about its neck and down its back was white as if with age and yet the face had not a wrinkle in it and the tenderest bloom was on the skin
285,the arms were very long and muscular the hands the same as if its hold were of uncommon strength
286,its legs and feet most delicately formed were like those upper members bare
287,it wore a tunic of the purest white and round its waist was bound a lustrous belt the sheen of which was beautiful
288,it held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand and in singular contradiction of that wintry emblem had its dress trimmed with summer flowers
289,but the strangest thing about it was that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear jet of light by which all this was visible and which was doubtless the occasion of its using in its duller moments a great extinguisher for a cap which it now held under its arm
290,even this though when scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness was not its strangest quality
291,for as its belt sparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another and what was light one instant at another time was dark so the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness being now a thing with one arm now with one leg now with twenty legs now a pair of legs without a head now a head without a body of which dissolving parts no outline would be visible in the dense gloom wherein they melted away
292,and in the very wonder of this it would be itself again distinct and clear as ever
293,are you the spirit sir whose coming was foretold to me asked scrooge i am the voice was soft and gentle
294,singularly low as if instead of being so close beside him it were at a distance
295,who and what are you scrooge demanded
296,i am the ghost of christmas past long past inquired scrooge observant of its dwarfish stature
297,no
298,your past perhaps scrooge could not have told anybody why if anybody could have asked him but he had a special desire to see the spirit in his cap and begged him to be covered
299,what exclaimed the ghost would you so soon put out with worldly hands the light i give is it not enough that you are one of those whose passions made this cap and force me through whole trains of years to wear it low upon my brow scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend or any knowledge of having wilfully bonneted the spirit at any period of his life
300,he then made bold to inquire what business brought him there
301,your welfare said the ghost scrooge expressed himself much obliged but could not help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that end
302,the spirit must have heard him thinking for it said immediately your reclamation then
303,take heed it put out its strong hand as it spoke and clasped him gently by the arm
304,rise and walk with me it would have been in vain for scrooge to plead that the weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes that bed was warm and the thermometer a long way below freezing that he was clad but lightly in his slippers dressinggown and nightcap and that he had a cold upon him at that time
305,the grasp though gentle as a womans hand was not to be resisted
306,he rose but finding that the spirit made towards the window clasped his robe in supplication
307,i am a mortal scrooge remonstrated and liable to fall bear but a touch of my hand there said the spirit laying it upon his heart and you shall be upheld in more than this as the words were spoken they passed through the wall and stood upon an open country road with fields on either hand
308,the city had entirely vanished
309,not a vestige of it was to be seen
310,the darkness and the mist had vanished with it for it was a clear cold winter day with snow upon the ground
311,good heaven said scrooge clasping his hands together as he looked about him
312,i was bred in this place
313,i was a boy here the spirit gazed upon him mildly
314,its gentle touch though it had been light and instantaneous appeared still present to the old mans sense of feeling
315,he was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air each one connected with a thousand thoughts and hopes and joys and cares long long forgotten your lip is trembling said the ghost and what is that upon your cheek scrooge muttered with an unusual catching in his voice that it was a pimple and begged the ghost to lead him where he would
316,you recollect the way inquired the spirit remember it cried scrooge with fervour i could walk it blindfold strange to have forgotten it for so many years observed the ghost let us go on they walked along the road scrooge recognising every gate and post and tree until a little markettown appeared in the distance with its bridge its church and winding river
317,some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them with boys upon their backs who called to other boys in country gigs and carts driven by farmers
318,all these boys were in great spirits and shouted to each other until the broad fields were so full of merry music that the crisp air laughed to hear it these are but shadows of the things that have been said the ghost they have no consciousness of us the jocund travellers came on and as they came scrooge knew and named them every one
319,why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them why did his cold eye glisten and his heart leap up as they went past why was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other merry christmas as they parted at crossroads and byeways for their several homes what was merry christmas to scrooge out upon merry christmas what good had it ever done to him the school is not quite deserted said the ghost a solitary child neglected by his friends is left there still scrooge said he knew it
320,and he sobbed
321,they left the highroad by a wellremembered lane and soon approached a mansion of dull red brick with a little weathercocksurmounted cupola on the roof and a bell hanging in it
322,it was a large house but one of broken fortunes for the spacious offices were little used their walls were damp and mossy their windows broken and their gates decayed
323,fowls clucked and strutted in the stables and the coachhouses and sheds were overrun with grass
324,nor was it more retentive of its ancient state within for entering the dreary hall and glancing through the open doors of many rooms they found them poorly furnished cold and vast
325,there was an earthy savour in the air a chilly bareness in the place which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by candlelight and not too much to eat
326,they went the ghost and scrooge across the hall to a door at the back of the house
327,it opened before them and disclosed a long bare melancholy room made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and desks
328,at one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire and scrooge sat down upon a form and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he used to be
329,not a latent echo in the house not a squeak and scuffle from the mice behind the panelling not a drip from the halfthawed waterspout in the dull yard behind not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar not the idle swinging of an empty storehouse door no not a clicking in the fire but fell upon the heart of scrooge with a softening influence and gave a freer passage to his tears
330,the spirit touched him on the arm and pointed to his younger self intent upon his reading
331,suddenly a man in foreign garments wonderfully real and distinct to look at stood outside the window with an axe stuck in his belt and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood
332,why its ali baba scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy
333,its dear old honest ali baba yes yes i know one christmas time when yonder solitary child was left here all alone he did come for the first time just like that
334,poor boy and valentine said scrooge and his wild brother orson there they go and whats his name who was put down in his drawers asleep at the gate of damascus dont you see him and the sultans groom turned upside down by the genii there he is upon his head serve him right
335,im glad of it
336,what business had he to be married to the princess to hear scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such subjects in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying and to see his heightened and excited face would have been a surprise to his business friends in the city indeed
337,theres the parrot cried scrooge green body and yellow tail with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head there he is poor robin crusoe he called him when he came home again after sailing round the island
338,poor robin crusoe where have you been robin crusoe the man thought he was dreaming but he wasnt
339,it was the parrot you know
340,there goes friday running for his life to the little creek halloa hoop halloo then with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character he said in pity for his former self poor boy and cried again
341,i wish scrooge muttered putting his hand in his pocket and looking about him after drying his eyes with his cuff but its too late now what is the matter asked the spirit nothing said scrooge nothing
342,there was a boy singing a christmas carol at my door last night
343,i should like to have given him something thats all the ghost smiled thoughtfully and waved its hand saying as it did so let us see another christmas scrooges former self grew larger at the words and the room became a little darker and more dirty
344,the panels shrunk the windows cracked fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling and the naked laths were shown instead but how all this was brought about scrooge knew no more than you do
345,he only knew that it was quite correct that everything had happened so that there he was alone again when all the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays
346,he was not reading now but walking up and down despairingly
347,scrooge looked at the ghost and with a mournful shaking of his head glanced anxiously towards the door
348,it opened and a little girl much younger than the boy came darting in and putting her arms about his neck and often kissing him addressed him as her dear dear brother i have come to bring you home dear brother said the child clapping her tiny hands and bending down to laugh
349,to bring you home home home home little fan returned the boy
350,yes said the child brimful of glee
351,home for good and all
352,home for ever and ever
353,father is so much kinder than he used to be that homes like heaven he spoke so gently to me one dear night when i was going to bed that i was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home and he said yes you should and sent me in a coach to bring you
354,and youre to be a man said the child opening her eyes and are never to come back here but first were to be together all the christmas long and have the merriest time in all the world you are quite a woman little fan exclaimed the boy
355,she clapped her hands and laughed and tried to touch his head but being too little laughed again and stood on tiptoe to embrace him
356,then she began to drag him in her childish eagerness towards the door and he nothing loth to go accompanied her
357,a terrible voice in the hall cried bring down master scrooges box there and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself who glared on master scrooge with a ferocious condescension and threw him into a dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him
358,he then conveyed him and his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering bestparlour that ever was seen where the maps upon the wall and the celestial and terrestrial globes in the windows were waxy with cold
359,here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine and a block of curiously heavy cake and administered instalments of those dainties to the young people at the same time sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of something to the postboy who answered that he thanked the gentleman but if it was the same tap as he had tasted before he had rather not
360,master scrooges trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the chaise the children bade the schoolmaster goodbye right willingly and getting into it drove gaily down the gardensweep the quick wheels dashing the hoarfrost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens like spray
361,always a delicate creature whom a breath might have withered said the ghost but she had a large heart so she had cried scrooge youre right
362,i will not gainsay it spirit god forbid she died a woman said the ghost and had as i think children one child scrooge returned
363,true said the ghost your nephew scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind and answered briefly yes although they had but that moment left the school behind them they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city where shadowy passengers passed and repassed where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way and all the strife and tumult of a real city were
364,it was made plain enough by the dressing of the shops that here too it was christmas time again but it was evening and the streets were lighted up
365,the ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door and asked scrooge if he knew it
366,know it said scrooge was i apprenticed here they went in
367,at sight of an old gentleman in a welsh wig sitting behind such a high desk that if he had been two inches taller he must have knocked his head against the ceiling scrooge cried in great excitement why its old fezziwig bless his heart its fezziwig alive again old fezziwig laid down his pen and looked up at the clock which pointed to the hour of seven
368,he rubbed his hands adjusted his capacious waistcoat laughed all over himself from his shoes to his organ of benevolence and called out in a comfortable oily rich fat jovial voice yo ho there ebenezer dick scrooges former self now grown a young man came briskly in accompanied by his fellowprentice
369,dick wilkins to be sure said scrooge to the ghost bless me yes
370,there he is
371,he was very much attached to me was dick poor dick dear dear yo ho my boys said fezziwig no more work tonight
372,christmas eve dick christmas ebenezer lets have the shutters up cried old fezziwig with a sharp clap of his hands before a man can say jack robinson you wouldnt believe how those two fellows went at it they charged into the street with the shuttersone two threehad em up in their placesfour five sixbarred em and pinned emseven eight nineand came back before you could have got to twelve panting like racehorses
373,hilliho cried old fezziwig skipping down from the high desk with wonderful agility
374,clear away my lads and lets have lots of room here hilliho dick chirrup ebenezer clear away there was nothing they wouldnt have cleared away or couldnt have cleared away with old fezziwig looking on
375,it was done in a minute
376,every movable was packed off as if it were dismissed from public life for evermore the floor was swept and watered the lamps were trimmed fuel was heaped upon the fire and the warehouse was as snug and warm and dry and bright a ballroom as you would desire to see upon a winters night
377,in came a fiddler with a musicbook and went up to the lofty desk and made an orchestra of it and tuned like fifty stomachaches
378,in came mrs fezziwig one vast substantial smile
379,in came the three miss fezziwigs beaming and lovable
380,in came the six young followers whose hearts they broke
381,in came all the young men and women employed in the business
382,in came the housemaid with her cousin the baker
383,in came the cook with her brothers particular friend the milkman
384,in came the boy from over the way who was suspected of not having board enough from his master trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one who was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress
385,in they all came one after another some shyly some boldly some gracefully some awkwardly some pushing some pulling in they all came anyhow and everyhow
386,away they all went twenty couple at once hands half round and back again the other way down the middle and up again round and round in various stages of affectionate grouping old top couple always turning up in the wrong place new top couple starting off again as soon as they got there all top couples at last and not a bottom one to help them when this result was brought about old fezziwig clapping his hands to stop the dance cried out well done and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter especially provided for that purpose
387,but scorning rest upon his reappearance he instantly began again though there were no dancers yet as if the other fiddler had been carried home exhausted on a shutter and he were a brannew man resolved to beat him out of sight or perish
388,there were more dances and there were forfeits and more dances and there was cake and there was negus and there was a great piece of cold roast and there was a great piece of cold boiled and there were mincepies and plenty of beer
389,but the great effect of the evening came after the roast and boiled when the fiddler (an artful dog mind the sort of man who knew his business better than you or i could have told it him) struck up sir roger de coverley then old fezziwig stood out to dance with mrs fezziwig top couple too with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them three or four and twenty pair of partners people who were not to be trifled with people who would dance and had no notion of walking
390,but if they had been twice as manyah four timesold fezziwig would have been a match for them and so would mrs fezziwig as to her she was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term
391,if thats not high praise tell me higher and ill use it
392,a positive light appeared to issue from fezziwigs calves
393,they shone in every part of the dance like moons
394,you couldnt have predicted at any given time what would have become of them next
395,and when old fezziwig and mrs fezziwig had gone all through the dance advance and retire both hands to your partner bow and curtsey corkscrew threadtheneedle and back again to your place fezziwig cutcut so deftly that he appeared to wink with his legs and came upon his feet again without a stagger
396,when the clock struck eleven this domestic ball broke up
397,mr and mrs fezziwig took their stations one on either side of the door and shaking hands with every person individually as he or she went out wished him or her a merry christmas when everybody had retired but the two prentices they did the same to them and thus the cheerful voices died away and the lads were left to their beds which were under a counter in the backshop
398,during the whole of this time scrooge had acted like a man out of his wits
399,his heart and soul were in the scene and with his former self
400,he corroborated everything remembered everything enjoyed everything and underwent the strangest agitation
401,it was not until now when the bright faces of his former self and dick were turned from them that he remembered the ghost and became conscious that it was looking full upon him while the light upon its head burnt very clear
402,a small matter said the ghost to make these silly folks so full of gratitude small echoed scrooge the spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices who were pouring out their hearts in praise of fezziwig and when he had done so said why is it not he has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money three or four perhaps
403,is that so much that he deserves this praise it isnt that said scrooge heated by the remark and speaking unconsciously like his former not his latter self
404,it isnt that spirit he has the power to render us happy or unhappy to make our service light or burdensome a pleasure or a toil
405,say that his power lies in words and looks in things so slight and insignificant that it is impossible to add and count em up what then the happiness he gives is quite as great as if it cost a fortune he felt the spirits glance and stopped
406,what is the matter asked the ghost nothing particular said scrooge something i think the ghost insisted
407,no said scrooge no
408,i should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk just now
409,thats all his former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish and scrooge and the ghost again stood side by side in the open air
410,my time grows short observed the spirit quick this was not addressed to scrooge or to any one whom he could see but it produced an immediate effect
411,for again scrooge saw himself
412,he was older now a man in the prime of life
413,his face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later years but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice
414,there was an eager greedy restless motion in the eye which showed the passion that had taken root and where the shadow of the growing tree would fall
415,he was not alone but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a mourningdress in whose eyes there were tears which sparkled in the light that shone out of the ghost of christmas past it matters little she said softly
416,to you very little
417,another idol has displaced me and if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come as i would have tried to do i have no just cause to grieve what idol has displaced you he rejoined
418,a golden one this is the evenhanded dealing of the world he said
419,there is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty and there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth you fear the world too much she answered gently
420,all your other hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid reproach
421,i have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one until the masterpassion gain engrosses you
422,have i not what then he retorted
423,even if i have grown so much wiser what then i am not changed towards you she shook her head
424,am i our contract is an old one
425,it was made when we were both poor and content to be so until in good season we could improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry
426,you are changed
427,when it was made you were another man i was a boy he said impatiently
428,your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are she returned
429,i am
430,that which promised happiness when we were one in heart is fraught with misery now that we are two
431,how often and how keenly i have thought of this i will not say
432,it is enough that i have thought of it and can release you have i ever sought release in words
433,no never in what then in a changed nature in an altered spirit in another atmosphere of life another hope as its great end
434,in everything that made my love of any worth or value in your sight
435,if this had never been between us said the girl looking mildly but with steadiness upon him tell me would you seek me out and try to win me now ah no he seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition in spite of himself
436,but he said with a struggle you think not i would gladly think otherwise if i could she answered heaven knows when i have learned a truth like this i know how strong and irresistible it must be
437,but if you were free today tomorrow yesterday can even i believe that you would choose a dowerless girlyou who in your very confidence with her weigh everything by gain or choosing her if for a moment you were false enough to your one guiding principle to do so do i not know that your repentance and regret would surely follow i do and i release you
438,with a full heart for the love of him you once were he was about to speak but with her head turned from him she resumed
439,you maythe memory of what is past half makes me hope you willhave pain in this
440,a very very brief time and you will dismiss the recollection of it gladly as an unprofitable dream from which it happened well that you awoke
441,may you be happy in the life you have chosen she left him and they parted
442,spirit said scrooge show me no more conduct me home
443,why do you delight to torture me one shadow more exclaimed the ghost no more cried scrooge no more
444,i dont wish to see it
445,show me no more but the relentless ghost pinioned him in both his arms and forced him to observe what happened next
446,they were in another scene and place a room not very large or handsome but full of comfort
447,near to the winter fire sat a beautiful young girl so like that last that scrooge believed it was the same until he saw her now a comely matron sitting opposite her daughter
448,the noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous for there were more children there than scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count and unlike the celebrated herd in the poem they were not forty children conducting themselves like one but every child was conducting itself like forty
449,the consequences were uproarious beyond belief but no one seemed to care on the contrary the mother and daughter laughed heartily and enjoyed it very much and the latter soon beginning to mingle in the sports got pillaged by the young brigands most ruthlessly
450,what would i not have given to be one of them though i never could have been so rude no no i wouldnt for the wealth of all the world have crushed that braided hair and torn it down and for the precious little shoe i wouldnt have plucked it off god bless my soul to save my life
451,as to measuring her waist in sport as they did bold young brood i couldnt have done it i should have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment and never come straight again
452,and yet i should have dearly liked i own to have touched her lips to have questioned her that she might have opened them to have looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes and never raised a blush to have let loose waves of hair an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price in short i should have liked i do confess to have had the lightest licence of a child and yet to have been man enough to know its value
453,but now a knocking at the door was heard and such a rush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and plundered dress was borne towards it the centre of a flushed and boisterous group just in time to greet the father who came home attended by a man laden with christmas toys and presents
454,then the shouting and the struggling and the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter the scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his pockets despoil him of brownpaper parcels hold on tight by his cravat hug him round his neck pommel his back and kick his legs in irrepressible affection the shouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package was received the terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in the act of putting a dolls fryingpan into his mouth and was more than suspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey glued on a wooden platter the immense relief of finding this a false alarm the joy and gratitude and ecstasy they are all indescribable alike
455,it is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions got out of the parlour and by one stair at a time up to the top of the house where they went to bed and so subsided
456,and now scrooge looked on more attentively than ever when the master of the house having his daughter leaning fondly on him sat down with her and her mother at his own fireside and when he thought that such another creature quite as graceful and as full of promise might have called him father and been a springtime in the haggard winter of his life his sight grew very dim indeed
457,belle said the husband turning to his wife with a smile i saw an old friend of yours this afternoon who was it guess how can i tut dont i know she added in the same breath laughing as he laughed
458,mr
459,scrooge mr
460,scrooge it was
461,i passed his office window and as it was not shut up and he had a candle inside i could scarcely help seeing him
462,his partner lies upon the point of death i hear and there he sat alone
463,quite alone in the world i do believe spirit said scrooge in a broken voice remove me from this place i told you these were shadows of the things that have been said the ghost that they are what they are do not blame me remove me scrooge exclaimed i cannot bear it he turned upon the ghost and seeing that it looked upon him with a face in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces it had shown him wrestled with it
464,leave me take me back
465,haunt me no longer in the struggle if that can be called a struggle in which the ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort of its adversary scrooge observed that its light was burning high and bright and dimly connecting that with its influence over him he seized the extinguishercap and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its head
466,the spirit dropped beneath it so that the extinguisher covered its whole form but though scrooge pressed it down with all his force he could not hide the light which streamed from under it in an unbroken flood upon the ground
467,he was conscious of being exhausted and overcome by an irresistible drowsiness and further of being in his own bedroom
468,he gave the cap a parting squeeze in which his hand relaxed and had barely time to reel to bed before he sank into a heavy sleep
469,stave iii the second of the three spirits awaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore and sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together scrooge had no occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the stroke of one he felt that he was restored to consciousness in the right nick of time for the especial purpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to him through jacob marleys intervention
470,but finding that he turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this new spectre would draw back he put them every one aside with his own hands and lying down again established a sharp lookout all round the bed
471,for he wished to challenge the spirit on the moment of its appearance and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous
472,gentlemen of the freeandeasy sort who plume themselves on being acquainted with a move or two and being usually equal to the timeofday express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing that they are good for anything from pitchandtoss to manslaughter between which opposite extremes no doubt there lies a tolerably wide and comprehensive range of subjects
473,without venturing for scrooge quite as hardily as this i dont mind calling on you to believe that he was ready for a good broad field of strange appearances and that nothing between a baby and rhinoceros would have astonished him very much
474,now being prepared for almost anything he was not by any means prepared for nothing and consequently when the bell struck one and no shape appeared he was taken with a violent fit of trembling
475,five minutes ten minutes a quarter of an hour went by yet nothing came
476,all this time he lay upon his bed the very core and centre of a blaze of ruddy light which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the hour and which being only light was more alarming than a dozen ghosts as he was powerless to make out what it meant or would be at and was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an interesting case of spontaneous combustion without having the consolation of knowing it
477,at last however he began to thinkas you or i would have thought at first for it is always the person not in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done in it and would unquestionably have done it tooat last i say he began to think that the source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining room from whence on further tracing it it seemed to shine
478,this idea taking full possession of his mind he got up softly and shuffled in his slippers to the door
479,the moment scrooges hand was on the lock a strange voice called him by his name and bade him enter
480,he obeyed
481,it was his own room
482,there was no doubt about that
483,but it had undergone a surprising transformation
484,the walls and ceiling were so hung with living green that it looked a perfect grove from every part of which bright gleaming berries glistened
485,the crisp leaves of holly mistletoe and ivy reflected back the light as if so many little mirrors had been scattered there and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney as that dull petrification of a hearth had never known in scrooges time or marleys or for many and many a winter season gone
486,heaped up on the floor to form a kind of throne were turkeys geese game poultry brawn great joints of meat suckingpigs long wreaths of sausages mincepies plumpuddings barrels of oysters redhot chestnuts cherrycheeked apples juicy oranges luscious pears immense twelfthcakes and seething bowls of punch that made the chamber dim with their delicious steam
487,in easy state upon this couch there sat a jolly giant glorious to see who bore a glowing torch in shape not unlike plentys horn and held it up high up to shed its light on scrooge as he came peeping round the door
488,come in exclaimed the ghost come in and know me better man scrooge entered timidly and hung his head before this spirit he was not the dogged scrooge he had been and though the spirits eyes were clear and kind he did not like to meet them
489,i am the ghost of christmas present said the spirit look upon me scrooge reverently did so
490,it was clothed in one simple green robe or mantle bordered with white fur
491,this garment hung so loosely on the figure that its capacious breast was bare as if disdaining to be warded or concealed by any artifice
492,its feet observable beneath the ample folds of the garment were also bare and on its head it wore no other covering than a holly wreath set here and there with shining icicles
493,its dark brown curls were long and free free as its genial face its sparkling eye its open hand its cheery voice its unconstrained demeanour and its joyful air
494,girded round its middle was an antique scabbard but no sword was in it and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust
495,you have never seen the like of me before exclaimed the spirit never scrooge made answer to it
496,have never walked forth with the younger members of my family meaning (for i am very young) my elder brothers born in these later years pursued the phantom i dont think i have said scrooge i am afraid i have not
497,have you had many brothers spirit more than eighteen hundred said the ghost a tremendous family to provide for muttered scrooge the ghost of christmas present rose
498,spirit said scrooge submissively conduct me where you will
499,i went forth last night on compulsion and i learnt a lesson which is working now
500,tonight if you have aught to teach me let me profit by it touch my robe scrooge did as he was told and held it fast
501,holly mistletoe red berries ivy turkeys geese game poultry brawn meat pigs sausages oysters pies puddings fruit and punch all vanished instantly
502,so did the room the fire the ruddy glow the hour of night and they stood in the city streets on christmas morning where (for the weather was severe) the people made a rough but brisk and not unpleasant kind of music in scraping the snow from the pavement in front of their dwellings and from the tops of their houses whence it was mad delight to the boys to see it come plumping down into the road below and splitting into artificial little snowstorms
503,the house fronts looked black enough and the windows blacker contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow upon the roofs and with the dirtier snow upon the ground which last deposit had been ploughed up in deep furrows by the heavy wheels of carts and waggons furrows that crossed and recrossed each other hundreds of times where the great streets branched off and made intricate channels hard to trace in the thick yellow mud and icy water
504,the sky was gloomy and the shortest streets were choked up with a dingy mist half thawed half frozen whose heavier particles descended in a shower of sooty atoms as if all the chimneys in great britain had by one consent caught fire and were blazing away to their dear hearts content
505,there was nothing very cheerful in the climate or the town and yet was there an air of cheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest summer sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain
506,for the people who were shovelling away on the housetops were jovial and full of glee calling out to one another from the parapets and now and then exchanging a facetious snowballbetternatured missile far than many a wordy jest laughing heartily if it went right and not less heartily if it went wrong
507,the poulterers shops were still half open and the fruiterers were radiant in their glory
508,there were great round potbellied baskets of chestnuts shaped like the waistcoats of jolly old gentlemen lolling at the doors and tumbling out into the street in their apoplectic opulence
509,there were ruddy brownfaced broadgirthed spanish onions shining in the fatness of their growth like spanish friars and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went by and glanced demurely at the hungup mistletoe
510,there were pears and apples clustered high in blooming pyramids there were bunches of grapes made in the shopkeepers benevolence to dangle from conspicuous hooks that peoples mouths might water gratis as they passed there were piles of filberts mossy and brown recalling in their fragrance ancient walks among the woods and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered leaves there were norfolk biffins squat and swarthy setting off the yellow of the oranges and lemons and in the great compactness of their juicy persons urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after dinner
511,the very gold and silver fish set forth among these choice fruits in a bowl though members of a dull and stagnantblooded race appeared to know that there was something going on and to a fish went gasping round and round their little world in slow and passionless excitement
512,the grocers oh the grocers nearly closed with perhaps two shutters down or one but through those gaps such glimpses it was not alone that the scales descending on the counter made a merry sound or that the twine and roller parted company so briskly or that the canisters were rattled up and down like juggling tricks or even that the blended scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose or even that the raisins were so plentiful and rare the almonds so extremely white the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight the other spices so delicious the candied fruits so caked and spotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookerson feel faint and subsequently bilious
513,nor was it that the figs were moist and pulpy or that the french plums blushed in modest tartness from their highlydecorated boxes or that everything was good to eat and in its christmas dress but the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the day that they tumbled up against each other at the door crashing their wicker baskets wildly and left their purchases upon the counter and came running back to fetch them and committed hundreds of the like mistakes in the best humour possible while the grocer and his people were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which they fastened their aprons behind might have been their own worn outside for general inspection and for christmas daws to peck at if they chose
514,but soon the steeples called good people all to church and chapel and away they came flocking through the streets in their best clothes and with their gayest faces
515,and at the same time there emerged from scores of byestreets lanes and nameless turnings innumerable people carrying their dinners to the bakers shops
516,the sight of these poor revellers appeared to interest the spirit very much for he stood with scrooge beside him in a bakers doorway and taking off the covers as their bearers passed sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch
517,and it was a very uncommon kind of torch for once or twice when there were angry words between some dinnercarriers who had jostled each other he shed a few drops of water on them from it and their good humour was restored directly
518,for they said it was a shame to quarrel upon christmas day and so it was god love it so it was in time the bells ceased and the bakers were shut up and yet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners and the progress of their cooking in the thawed blotch of wet above each bakers oven where the pavement smoked as if its stones were cooking too
519,is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch asked scrooge there is
520,my own would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day asked scrooge to any kindly given
521,to a poor one most why to a poor one most asked scrooge because it needs it most spirit said scrooge after a moments thought i wonder you of all the beings in the many worlds about us should desire to cramp these peoples opportunities of innocent enjoyment i cried the spirit you would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh day often the only day on which they can be said to dine at all said scrooge wouldnt you i cried the spirit you seek to close these places on the seventh day said scrooge and it comes to the same thing i seek exclaimed the spirit forgive me if i am wrong
522,it has been done in your name or at least in that of your family said scrooge there are some upon this earth of yours returned the spirit who lay claim to know us and who do their deeds of passion pride illwill hatred envy bigotry and selfishness in our name who are as strange to us and all our kith and kin as if they had never lived
523,remember that and charge their doings on themselves not us scrooge promised that he would and they went on invisible as they had been before into the suburbs of the town
524,it was a remarkable quality of the ghost (which scrooge had observed at the bakers) that notwithstanding his gigantic size he could accommodate himself to any place with ease and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as gracefully and like a supernatural creature as it was possible he could have done in any lofty hall
525,and perhaps it was the pleasure the good spirit had in showing off this power of his or else it was his own kind generous hearty nature and his sympathy with all poor men that led him straight to scrooges clerks for there he went and took scrooge with him holding to his robe and on the threshold of the door the spirit smiled and stopped to bless bob cratchits dwelling with the sprinkling of his torch
526,think of that bob had but fifteen bob aweek himself he pocketed on saturdays but fifteen copies of his christian name and yet the ghost of christmas present blessed his fourroomed house then up rose mrs cratchit cratchits wife dressed out but poorly in a twiceturned gown but brave in ribbons which are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence and she laid the cloth assisted by belinda cratchit second of her daughters also brave in ribbons while master peter cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes and getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar (bobs private property conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the day) into his mouth rejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable parks and now two smaller cratchits boy and girl came tearing in screaming that outside the bakers they had smelt the goose and known it for their own and basking in luxurious thoughts of sage and onion these young cratchits danced about the table and exalted master peter cratchit to the skies while he (not proud although his collars nearly choked him) blew the fire until the slow potatoes bubbling up knocked loudly at the saucepanlid to be let out and peeled
527,what has ever got your precious father then said mrs cratchit and your brother tiny tim and martha warnt as late last christmas day by halfanhour heres martha mother said a girl appearing as she spoke
528,heres martha mother cried the two young cratchits hurrah theres such a goose martha why bless your heart alive my dear how late you are said mrs cratchit kissing her a dozen times and taking off her shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal
529,wed a deal of work to finish up last night replied the girl and had to clear away this morning mother well never mind so long as you are come said mrs cratchit sit ye down before the fire my dear and have a warm lord bless ye no no theres father coming cried the two young cratchits who were everywhere at once
530,hide martha hide so martha hid herself and in came little bob the father with at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe hanging down before him and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed to look seasonable and tiny tim upon his shoulder
531,alas for tiny tim he bore a little crutch and had his limbs supported by an iron frame why wheres our martha cried bob cratchit looking round
532,not coming said mrs cratchit not coming said bob with a sudden declension in his high spirits for he had been tims blood horse all the way from church and had come home rampant
533,not coming upon christmas day martha didnt like to see him disappointed if it were only in joke so she came out prematurely from behind the closet door and ran into his arms while the two young cratchits hustled tiny tim and bore him off into the washhouse that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper
534,and how did little tim behave asked mrs cratchit when she had rallied bob on his credulity and bob had hugged his daughter to his hearts content
535,as good as gold said bob and better
536,somehow he gets thoughtful sitting by himself so much and thinks the strangest things you ever heard
537,he told me coming home that he hoped the people saw him in the church because he was a cripple and it might be pleasant to them to remember upon christmas day who made lame beggars walk and blind men see bobs voice was tremulous when he told them this and trembled more when he said that tiny tim was growing strong and hearty
538,his active little crutch was heard upon the floor and back came tiny tim before another word was spoken escorted by his brother and sister to his stool before the fire and while bob turning up his cuffsas if poor fellow they were capable of being made more shabbycompounded some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons and stirred it round and round and put it on the hob to simmer master peter and the two ubiquitous young cratchits went to fetch the goose with which they soon returned in high procession
539,such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of all birds a feathered phenomenon to which a black swan was a matter of courseand in truth it was something very like it in that house
540,mrs cratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing hot master peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour miss belinda sweetened up the applesauce martha dusted the hot plates bob took tiny tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table the two young cratchits set chairs for everybody not forgetting themselves and mounting guard upon their posts crammed spoons into their mouths lest they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped
541,at last the dishes were set on and grace was said
542,it was succeeded by a breathless pause as mrs cratchit looking slowly all along the carvingknife prepared to plunge it in the breast but when she did and when the long expected gush of stuffing issued forth one murmur of delight arose all round the board and even tiny tim excited by the two young cratchits beat on the table with the handle of his knife and feebly cried hurrah there never was such a goose
543,bob said he didnt believe there ever was such a goose cooked
544,its tenderness and flavour size and cheapness were the themes of universal admiration
545,eked out by applesauce and mashed potatoes it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family indeed as mrs cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small atom of a bone upon the dish) they hadnt ate it all at last yet every one had had enough and the youngest cratchits in particular were steeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows but now the plates being changed by miss belinda mrs cratchit left the room alonetoo nervous to bear witnessesto take the pudding up and bring it in
546,suppose it should not be done enough suppose it should break in turning out suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the backyard and stolen it while they were merry with the goosea supposition at which the two young cratchits became livid all sorts of horrors were supposed
547,hallo a great deal of steam the pudding was out of the copper
548,a smell like a washingday that was the cloth
549,a smell like an eatinghouse and a pastrycooks next door to each other with a laundresss next door to that that was the pudding in half a minute mrs cratchit enteredflushed but smiling proudlywith the pudding like a speckled cannonball so hard and firm blazing in half of halfaquartern of ignited brandy and bedight with christmas holly stuck into the top
550,oh a wonderful pudding bob cratchit said and calmly too that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by mrs cratchit since their marriage
551,mrs cratchit said that now the weight was off her mind she would confess she had had her doubts about the quantity of flour
552,everybody had something to say about it but nobody said or thought it was at all a small pudding for a large family
553,it would have been flat heresy to do so
554,any cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a thing
555,at last the dinner was all done the cloth was cleared the hearth swept and the fire made up
556,the compound in the jug being tasted and considered perfect apples and oranges were put upon the table and a shovelfull of chestnuts on the fire
557,then all the cratchit family drew round the hearth in what bob cratchit called a circle meaning half a one and at bob cratchits elbow stood the family display of glass
558,two tumblers and a custardcup without a handle
559,these held the hot stuff from the jug however as well as golden goblets would have done and bob served it out with beaming looks while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily
560,then bob proposed a merry christmas to us all my dears
561,god bless us which all the family reechoed
562,god bless us every one said tiny tim the last of all
563,he sat very close to his fathers side upon his little stool
564,bob held his withered little hand in his as if he loved the child and wished to keep him by his side and dreaded that he might be taken from him
565,spirit said scrooge with an interest he had never felt before tell me if tiny tim will live i see a vacant seat replied the ghost in the poor chimneycorner and a crutch without an owner carefully preserved
566,if these shadows remain unaltered by the future the child will die no no said scrooge oh no kind spirit say he will be spared if these shadows remain unaltered by the future none other of my race returned the ghost will find him here
567,what then if he be like to die he had better do it and decrease the surplus population scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the spirit and was overcome with penitence and grief
568,man said the ghost if man you be in heart not adamant forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered what the surplus is and where it is
569,will you decide what men shall live what men shall die it may be that in the sight of heaven you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor mans child
570,oh god to hear the insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry brothers in the dust scrooge bent before the ghosts rebuke and trembling cast his eyes upon the ground
571,but he raised them speedily on hearing his own name
572,mr
573,scrooge said bob ill give you mr scrooge the founder of the feast the founder of the feast indeed cried mrs cratchit reddening
574,i wish i had him here
575,id give him a piece of my mind to feast upon and i hope hed have a good appetite for it my dear said bob the children christmas day it should be christmas day i am sure said she on which one drinks the health of such an odious stingy hard unfeeling man as mr scrooge you know he is robert nobody knows it better than you do poor fellow my dear was bobs mild answer christmas day ill drink his health for your sake and the days said mrs cratchit not for his
576,long life to him a merry christmas and a happy new year hell be very merry and very happy i have no doubt the children drank the toast after her
577,it was the first of their proceedings which had no heartiness
578,tiny tim drank it last of all but he didnt care twopence for it
579,scrooge was the ogre of the family
580,the mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party which was not dispelled for full five minutes
581,after it had passed away they were ten times merrier than before from the mere relief of scrooge the baleful being done with
582,bob cratchit told them how he had a situation in his eye for master peter which would bring in if obtained full fiveandsixpence weekly
583,the two young cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of peters being a man of business and peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from between his collars as if he were deliberating what particular investments he should favour when he came into the receipt of that bewildering income
584,martha who was a poor apprentice at a milliners then told them what kind of work she had to do and how many hours she worked at a stretch and how she meant to lie abed tomorrow morning for a good long rest tomorrow being a holiday she passed at home
585,also how she had seen a countess and a lord some days before and how the lord was much about as tall as peter at which peter pulled up his collars so high that you couldnt have seen his head if you had been there
586,all this time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round and byandbye they had a song about a lost child travelling in the snow from tiny tim who had a plaintive little voice and sang it very well indeed
587,there was nothing of high mark in this
588,they were not a handsome family they were not well dressed their shoes were far from being waterproof their clothes were scanty and peter might have known and very likely did the inside of a pawnbrokers
589,but they were happy grateful pleased with one another and contented with the time and when they faded and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the spirits torch at parting scrooge had his eye upon them and especially on tiny tim until the last
590,by this time it was getting dark and snowing pretty heavily and as scrooge and the spirit went along the streets the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens parlours and all sorts of rooms was wonderful
591,here the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner with hot plates baking through and through before the fire and deep red curtains ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness
592,there all the children of the house were running out into the snow to meet their married sisters brothers cousins uncles aunts and be the first to greet them
593,here again were shadows on the windowblind of guests assembling and there a group of handsome girls all hooded and furbooted and all chattering at once tripped lightly off to some near neighbours house where woe upon the single man who saw them enterartful witches well they knew itin a glow but if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to friendly gatherings you might have thought that no one was at home to give them welcome when they got there instead of every house expecting company and piling up its fires halfchimney high
594,blessings on it how the ghost exulted how it bared its breadth of breast and opened its capacious palm and floated on outpouring with a generous hand its bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach the very lamplighter who ran on before dotting the dusky street with specks of light and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere laughed out loudly as the spirit passed though little kenned the lamplighter that he had any company but christmas and now without a word of warning from the ghost they stood upon a bleak and desert moor where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast about as though it were the burialplace of giants and water spread itself wheresoever it listed or would have done so but for the frost that held it prisoner and nothing grew but moss and furze and coarse rank grass
595,down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery red which glared upon the desolation for an instant like a sullen eye and frowning lower lower lower yet was lost in the thick gloom of darkest night
596,what place is this asked scrooge a place where miners live who labour in the bowels of the earth returned the spirit but they know me
597,see a light shone from the window of a hut and swiftly they advanced towards it
598,passing through the wall of mud and stone they found a cheerful company assembled round a glowing fire
599,an old old man and woman with their children and their childrens children and another generation beyond that all decked out gaily in their holiday attire
600,the old man in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind upon the barren waste was singing them a christmas songit had been a very old song when he was a boyand from time to time they all joined in the chorus
601,so surely as they raised their voices the old man got quite blithe and loud and so surely as they stopped his vigour sank again
602,the spirit did not tarry here but bade scrooge hold his robe and passing on above the moor spedwhither not to sea to sea
603,to scrooges horror looking back he saw the last of the land a frightful range of rocks behind them and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water as it rolled and roared and raged among the dreadful caverns it had worn and fiercely tried to undermine the earth
604,built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks some league or so from shore on which the waters chafed and dashed the wild year through there stood a solitary lighthouse
605,great heaps of seaweed clung to its base and stormbirds born of the wind one might suppose as seaweed of the waterrose and fell about it like the waves they skimmed
606,but even here two men who watched the light had made a fire that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of brightness on the awful sea
607,joining their horny hands over the rough table at which they sat they wished each other merry christmas in their can of grog and one of them the elder too with his face all damaged and scarred with hard weather as the figurehead of an old ship might be struck up a sturdy song that was like a gale in itself
608,again the ghost sped on above the black and heaving sea on onuntil being far away as he told scrooge from any shore they lighted on a ship
609,they stood beside the helmsman at the wheel the lookout in the bow the officers who had the watch dark ghostly figures in their several stations but every man among them hummed a christmas tune or had a christmas thought or spoke below his breath to his companion of some bygone christmas day with homeward hopes belonging to it
610,and every man on board waking or sleeping good or bad had had a kinder word for another on that day than on any day in the year and had shared to some extent in its festivities and had remembered those he cared for at a distance and had known that they delighted to remember him
611,it was a great surprise to scrooge while listening to the moaning of the wind and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown abyss whose depths were secrets as profound as death it was a great surprise to scrooge while thus engaged to hear a hearty laugh
612,it was a much greater surprise to scrooge to recognise it as his own nephews and to find himself in a bright dry gleaming room with the spirit standing smiling by his side and looking at that same nephew with approving affability ha ha laughed scrooges nephew
613,ha ha ha if you should happen by any unlikely chance to know a man more blest in a laugh than scrooges nephew all i can say is i should like to know him too
614,introduce him to me and ill cultivate his acquaintance
615,it is a fair evenhanded noble adjustment of things that while there is infection in disease and sorrow there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and goodhumour
616,when scrooges nephew laughed in this way holding his sides rolling his head and twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions scrooges niece by marriage laughed as heartily as he
617,and their assembled friends being not a bit behindhand roared out lustily
618,ha ha ha ha ha ha he said that christmas was a humbug as i live cried scrooges nephew
619,he believed it too more shame for him fred said scrooges niece indignantly
620,bless those women they never do anything by halves
621,they are always in earnest
622,she was very pretty exceedingly pretty
623,with a dimpled surprisedlooking capital face a ripe little mouth that seemed made to be kissedas no doubt it was all kinds of good little dots about her chin that melted into one another when she laughed and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creatures head
624,altogether she was what you would have called provoking you know but satisfactory too
625,oh perfectly satisfactory
626,hes a comical old fellow said scrooges nephew thats the truth and not so pleasant as he might be
627,however his offences carry their own punishment and i have nothing to say against him im sure he is very rich fred hinted scrooges niece
628,at least you always tell me so what of that my dear said scrooges nephew
629,his wealth is of no use to him
630,he dont do any good with it
631,he dont make himself comfortable with it
632,he hasnt the satisfaction of thinkingha ha hathat he is ever going to benefit us with it i have no patience with him observed scrooges niece
633,scrooges nieces sisters and all the other ladies expressed the same opinion
634,oh i have said scrooges nephew
635,i am sorry for him i couldnt be angry with him if i tried
636,who suffers by his ill whims himself always
637,here he takes it into his head to dislike us and he wont come and dine with us
638,whats the consequence he dont lose much of a dinner indeed i think he loses a very good dinner interrupted scrooges niece
639,everybody else said the same and they must be allowed to have been competent judges because they had just had dinner and with the dessert upon the table were clustered round the fire by lamplight
640,well im very glad to hear it said scrooges nephew because i havent great faith in these young housekeepers
641,what do you say topper topper had clearly got his eye upon one of scrooges nieces sisters for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast who had no right to express an opinion on the subject
642,whereat scrooges nieces sisterthe plump one with the lace tucker not the one with the rosesblushed
643,do go on fred said scrooges niece clapping her hands
644,he never finishes what he begins to say he is such a ridiculous fellow scrooges nephew revelled in another laugh and as it was impossible to keep the infection off though the plump sister tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar his example was unanimously followed
645,i was only going to say said scrooges nephew that the consequence of his taking a dislike to us and not making merry with us is as i think that he loses some pleasant moments which could do him no harm
646,i am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts either in his mouldy old office or his dusty chambers
647,i mean to give him the same chance every year whether he likes it or not for i pity him
648,he may rail at christmas till he dies but he cant help thinking better of iti defy himif he finds me going there in good temper year after year and saying uncle scrooge how are you if it only puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds thats something and i think i shook him yesterday it was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking scrooge but being thoroughly goodnatured and not much caring what they laughed at so that they laughed at any rate he encouraged them in their merriment and passed the bottle joyously
649,after tea they had some music
650,for they were a musical family and knew what they were about when they sung a glee or catch i can assure you especially topper who could growl away in the bass like a good one and never swell the large veins in his forehead or get red in the face over it
651,scrooges niece played well upon the harp and played among other tunes a simple little air (a mere nothing you might learn to whistle it in two minutes) which had been familiar to the child who fetched scrooge from the boardingschool as he had been reminded by the ghost of christmas past when this strain of music sounded all the things that ghost had shown him came upon his mind he softened more and more and thought that if he could have listened to it often years ago he might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands without resorting to the sextons spade that buried jacob marley but they didnt devote the whole evening to music
652,after a while they played at forfeits for it is good to be children sometimes and never better than at christmas when its mighty founder was a child himself
653,stop there was first a game at blindmans buff
654,of course there was
655,and i no more believe topper was really blind than i believe he had eyes in his boots
656,my opinion is that it was a done thing between him and scrooges nephew and that the ghost of christmas present knew it
657,the way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker was an outrage on the credulity of human nature
658,knocking down the fireirons tumbling over the chairs bumping against the piano smothering himself among the curtains wherever she went there went he he always knew where the plump sister was
659,he wouldnt catch anybody else
660,if you had fallen up against him (as some of them did) on purpose he would have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you which would have been an affront to your understanding and would instantly have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister
661,she often cried out that it wasnt fair and it really was not
662,but when at last he caught her when in spite of all her silken rustlings and her rapid flutterings past him he got her into a corner whence there was no escape then his conduct was the most execrable
663,for his pretending not to know her his pretending that it was necessary to touch her headdress and further to assure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her finger and a certain chain about her neck was vile monstrous no doubt she told him her opinion of it when another blindman being in office they were so very confidential together behind the curtains
664,scrooges niece was not one of the blindmans buff party but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool in a snug corner where the ghost and scrooge were close behind her
665,but she joined in the forfeits and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet
666,likewise at the game of how when and where she was very great and to the secret joy of scrooges nephew beat her sisters hollow though they were sharp girls too as topper could have told you
667,there might have been twenty people there young and old but they all played and so did scrooge for wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on that his voice made no sound in their ears he sometimes came out with his guess quite loud and very often guessed quite right too for the sharpest needle best whitechapel warranted not to cut in the eye was not sharper than scrooge blunt as he took it in his head to be
668,the ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood and looked upon him with such favour that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed
669,but this the spirit said could not be done
670,here is a new game said scrooge one half hour spirit only one it was a game called yes and no where scrooges nephew had to think of something and the rest must find out what he only answering to their questions yes or no as the case was
671,the brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed elicited from him that he was thinking of an animal a live animal rather a disagreeable animal a savage animal an animal that growled and grunted sometimes and talked sometimes and lived in london and walked about the streets and wasnt made a show of and wasnt led by anybody and didnt live in a menagerie and was never killed in a market and was not a horse or an ass or a cow or a bull or a tiger or a dog or a pig or a cat or a bear
672,at every fresh question that was put to him this nephew burst into a fresh roar of laughter and was so inexpressibly tickled that he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp
673,at last the plump sister falling into a similar state cried out i have found it out i know what it is fred i know what it is what is it cried fred its your uncle scroooooge which it certainly was
674,admiration was the universal sentiment though some objected that the reply to is it a bear ought to have been yes inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts from mr scrooge supposing they had ever had any tendency that way
675,he has given us plenty of merriment i am sure said fred and it would be ungrateful not to drink his health
676,here is a glass of mulled wine ready to our hand at the moment and i say uncle scrooge well uncle scrooge they cried
677,a merry christmas and a happy new year to the old man whatever he is said scrooges nephew
678,he wouldnt take it from me but may he have it nevertheless
679,uncle scrooge uncle scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart that he would have pledged the unconscious company in return and thanked them in an inaudible speech if the ghost had given him time
680,but the whole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his nephew and he and the spirit were again upon their travels
681,much they saw and far they went and many homes they visited but always with a happy end
682,the spirit stood beside sick beds and they were cheerful on foreign lands and they were close at home by struggling men and they were patient in their greater hope by poverty and it was rich
683,in almshouse hospital and jail in miserys every refuge where vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast the door and barred the spirit out he left his blessing and taught scrooge his precepts
684,it was a long night if it were only a night but scrooge had his doubts of this because the christmas holidays appeared to be condensed into the space of time they passed together
685,it was strange too that while scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form the ghost grew older clearly older
686,scrooge had observed this change but never spoke of it until they left a childrens twelfth night party when looking at the spirit as they stood together in an open place he noticed that its hair was grey
687,are spirits lives so short asked scrooge my life upon this globe is very brief replied the ghost it ends tonight tonight cried scrooge tonight at midnight
688,hark the time is drawing near the chimes were ringing the three quarters past eleven at that moment
689,forgive me if i am not justified in what i ask said scrooge looking intently at the spirits robe but i see something strange and not belonging to yourself protruding from your skirts
690,is it a foot or a claw it might be a claw for the flesh there is upon it was the spirits sorrowful reply
691,look here from the foldings of its robe it brought two children wretched abject frightful hideous miserable
692,they knelt down at its feet and clung upon the outside of its garment
693,oh man look here
694,look look down here exclaimed the ghost they were a boy and girl
695,yellow meagre ragged scowling wolfish but prostrate too in their humility
696,where graceful youth should have filled their features out and touched them with its freshest tints a stale and shrivelled hand like that of age had pinched and twisted them and pulled them into shreds
697,where angels might have sat enthroned devils lurked and glared out menacing
698,no change no degradation no perversion of humanity in any grade through all the mysteries of wonderful creation has monsters half so horrible and dread
699,scrooge started back appalled
700,having them shown to him in this way he tried to say they were fine children but the words choked themselves rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude
701,spirit are they yours scrooge could say no more
702,they are mans said the spirit looking down upon them
703,and they cling to me appealing from their fathers
704,this boy is ignorance this girl is want beware them both and all of their degree but most of all beware this boy for on his brow i see that written which is doom unless the writing be erased
705,deny it cried the spirit stretching out its hand towards the city
706,slander those who tell it ye admit it for your factious purposes and make it worse
707,and bide the end have they no refuge or resource cried scrooge are there no prisons said the spirit turning on him for the last time with his own words
708,are there no workhouses the bell struck twelve
709,scrooge looked about him for the ghost and saw it not
710,as the last stroke ceased to vibrate he remembered the prediction of old jacob marley and lifting up his eyes beheld a solemn phantom draped and hooded coming like a mist along the ground towards him
711,stave iv the last of the spirits the phantom slowly gravely silently approached
712,when it came near him scrooge bent down upon his knee for in the very air through which this spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery
713,it was shrouded in a deep black garment which concealed its head its face its form and left nothing of it visible save one outstretched hand
714,but for this it would have been difficult to detach its figure from the night and separate it from the darkness by which it was surrounded
715,he felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him and that its mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread
716,he knew no more for the spirit neither spoke nor moved
717,i am in the presence of the ghost of christmas yet to come said scrooge the spirit answered not but pointed onward with its hand
718,you are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened but will happen in the time before us scrooge pursued
719,is that so spirit the upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its folds as if the spirit had inclined its head
720,that was the only answer he received
721,although well used to ghostly company by this time scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him and he found that he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it
722,the spirit paused a moment as observing his condition and giving him time to recover
723,but scrooge was all the worse for this
724,it thrilled him with a vague uncertain horror to know that behind the dusky shroud there were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon him while he though he stretched his own to the utmost could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great heap of black
725,ghost of the future he exclaimed i fear you more than any spectre i have seen
726,but as i know your purpose is to do me good and as i hope to live to be another man from what i was i am prepared to bear you company and do it with a thankful heart
727,will you not speak to me it gave him no reply
728,the hand was pointed straight before them
729,lead on said scrooge lead on the night is waning fast and it is precious time to me i know
730,lead on spirit the phantom moved away as it had come towards him
731,scrooge followed in the shadow of its dress which bore him up he thought and carried him along
732,they scarcely seemed to enter the city for the city rather seemed to spring up about them and encompass them of its own act
733,but there they were in the heart of it on change amongst the merchants who hurried up and down and chinked the money in their pockets and conversed in groups and looked at their watches and trifled thoughtfully with their great gold seals and so forth as scrooge had seen them often
734,the spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men
735,observing that the hand was pointed to them scrooge advanced to listen to their talk
736,no said a great fat man with a monstrous chin i dont know much about it either way
737,i only know hes dead when did he die inquired another
738,last night i believe why what was the matter with him asked a third taking a vast quantity of snuff out of a very large snuffbox
739,i thought hed never die god knows said the first with a yawn
740,what has he done with his money asked a redfaced gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on the end of his nose that shook like the gills of a turkeycock
741,i havent heard said the man with the large chin yawning again
742,left it to his company perhaps
743,he hasnt left it to me
744,thats all i know this pleasantry was received with a general laugh
745,its likely to be a very cheap funeral said the same speaker for upon my life i dont know of anybody to go to it
746,suppose we make up a party and volunteer i dont mind going if a lunch is provided observed the gentleman with the excrescence on his nose
747,but i must be fed if i make one another laugh
748,well i am the most disinterested among you after all said the first speaker for i never wear black gloves and i never eat lunch
749,but ill offer to go if anybody else will
750,when i come to think of it im not at all sure that i wasnt his most particular friend for we used to stop and speak whenever we met
751,bye bye speakers and listeners strolled away and mixed with other groups
752,scrooge knew the men and looked towards the spirit for an explanation
753,the phantom glided on into a street
754,its finger pointed to two persons meeting
755,scrooge listened again thinking that the explanation might lie here
756,he knew these men also perfectly
757,they were men of business very wealthy and of great importance
758,he had made a point always of standing well in their esteem in a business point of view that is strictly in a business point of view
759,how are you said one
760,how are you returned the other
761,well said the first
762,old scratch has got his own at last hey so i am told returned the second
763,cold isnt it seasonable for christmas time
764,youre not a skater i suppose no
765,no something else to think of
766,good morning not another word
767,that was their meeting their conversation and their parting
768,scrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so trivial but feeling assured that they must have some hidden purpose he set himself to consider what it was likely to be
769,they could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the death of jacob his old partner for that was past and this ghosts province was the future nor could he think of any one immediately connected with himself to whom he could apply them
770,but nothing doubting that to whomsoever they applied they had some latent moral for his own improvement he resolved to treasure up every word he heard and everything he saw and especially to observe the shadow of himself when it appeared
771,for he had an expectation that the conduct of his future self would give him the clue he missed and would render the solution of these riddles easy
772,he looked about in that very place for his own image but another man stood in his accustomed corner and though the clock pointed to his usual time of day for being there he saw no likeness of himself among the multitudes that poured in through the porch it gave him little surprise however for he had been revolving in his mind a change of life and thought and hoped he saw his newborn resolutions carried out in this
773,quiet and dark beside him stood the phantom with its outstretched hand
774,when he roused himself from his thoughtful quest he fancied from the turn of the hand and its situation in reference to himself that the unseen eyes were looking at him keenly
775,it made him shudder and feel very cold
776,they left the busy scene and went into an obscure part of the town where scrooge had never penetrated before although he recognised its situation and its bad repute
777,the ways were foul and narrow the shops and houses wretched the people halfnaked drunken slipshod ugly
778,alleys and archways like so many cesspools disgorged their offences of smell and dirt and life upon the straggling streets and the whole quarter reeked with crime with filth and misery
779,far in this den of infamous resort there was a lowbrowed beetling shop below a penthouse roof where iron old rags bottles bones and greasy offal were bought
780,upon the floor within were piled up heaps of rusty keys nails chains hinges files scales weights and refuse iron of all kinds
781,secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in mountains of unseemly rags masses of corrupted fat and sepulchres of bones
782,sitting in among the wares he dealt in by a charcoal stove made of old bricks was a greyhaired rascal nearly seventy years of age who had screened himself from the cold air without by a frousy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters hung upon a line and smoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement
783,scrooge and the phantom came into the presence of this man just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop
784,but she had scarcely entered when another woman similarly laden came in too and she was closely followed by a man in faded black who was no less startled by the sight of them than they had been upon the recognition of each other
785,after a short period of blank astonishment in which the old man with the pipe had joined them they all three burst into a laugh
786,let the charwoman alone to be the first cried she who had entered first
787,let the laundress alone to be the second and let the undertakers man alone to be the third
788,look here old joe heres a chance if we havent all three met here without meaning it you couldnt have met in a better place said old joe removing his pipe from his mouth
789,come into the parlour
790,you were made free of it long ago you know and the other two ant strangers
791,stop till i shut the door of the shop
792,ah how it skreeks there ant such a rusty bit of metal in the place as its own hinges i believe and im sure theres no such old bones here as mine
793,ha ha were all suitable to our calling were well matched
794,come into the parlour
795,come into the parlour the parlour was the space behind the screen of rags
796,the old man raked the fire together with an old stairrod and having trimmed his smoky lamp (for it was night) with the stem of his pipe put it in his mouth again
797,while he did this the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on the floor and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool crossing her elbows on her knees and looking with a bold defiance at the other two
798,what odds then what odds mrs dilber said the woman
799,every person has a right to take care of themselves
800,he always did thats true indeed said the laundress
801,no man more so why then dont stand staring as if you was afraid woman whos the wiser were not going to pick holes in each others coats i suppose no indeed said mrs dilber and the man together
802,we should hope not very well then cried the woman
803,thats enough
804,whos the worse for the loss of a few things like these not a dead man i suppose no indeed said mrs dilber laughing
805,if he wanted to keep em after he was dead a wicked old screw pursued the woman why wasnt he natural in his lifetime if he had been hed have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with death instead of lying gasping out his last there alone by himself its the truest word that ever was spoke said mrs dilber its a judgment on him i wish it was a little heavier judgment replied the woman and it should have been you may depend upon it if i could have laid my hands on anything else
806,open that bundle old joe and let me know the value of it
807,speak out plain
808,im not afraid to be the first nor afraid for them to see it
809,we know pretty well that we were helping ourselves before we met here i believe
810,its no sin
811,open the bundle joe but the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this and the man in faded black mounting the breach first produced his plunder
812,it was not extensive
813,a seal or two a pencilcase a pair of sleevebuttons and a brooch of no great value were all
814,they were severally examined and appraised by old joe who chalked the sums he was disposed to give for each upon the wall and added them up into a total when he found there was nothing more to come
815,thats your account said joe and i wouldnt give another sixpence if i was to be boiled for not doing it
816,whos next mrs dilber was next
817,sheets and towels a little wearing apparel two oldfashioned silver teaspoons a pair of sugartongs and a few boots
818,her account was stated on the wall in the same manner
819,i always give too much to ladies
820,its a weakness of mine and thats the way i ruin myself said old joe thats your account
821,if you asked me for another penny and made it an open question id repent of being so liberal and knock off halfacrown and now undo my bundle joe said the first woman
822,joe went down on his knees for the greater convenience of opening it and having unfastened a great many knots dragged out a large and heavy roll of some dark stuff
823,what do you call this said joe bedcurtains ah returned the woman laughing and leaning forward on her crossed arms
824,bedcurtains you dont mean to say you took em down rings and all with him lying there said joe yes i do replied the woman
825,why not you were born to make your fortune said joe and youll certainly do it i certainly shant hold my hand when i can get anything in it by reaching it out for the sake of such a man as he was i promise you joe returned the woman coolly
826,dont drop that oil upon the blankets now his blankets asked joe whose elses do you think replied the woman
827,he isnt likely to take cold without em i dare say i hope he didnt die of anything catching eh said old joe stopping in his work and looking up
828,dont you be afraid of that returned the woman
829,i ant so fond of his company that id loiter about him for such things if he did
830,ah you may look through that shirt till your eyes ache but you wont find a hole in it nor a threadbare place
831,its the best he had and a fine one too
832,theyd have wasted it if it hadnt been for me what do you call wasting of it asked old joe putting it on him to be buried in to be sure replied the woman with a laugh
833,somebody was fool enough to do it but i took it off again
834,if calico ant good enough for such a purpose it isnt good enough for anything
835,its quite as becoming to the body
836,he cant look uglier than he did in that one scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror
837,as they sat grouped about their spoil in the scanty light afforded by the old mans lamp he viewed them with a detestation and disgust which could hardly have been greater though they had been obscene demons marketing the corpse itself
838,ha ha laughed the same woman when old joe producing a flannel bag with money in it told out their several gains upon the ground
839,this is the end of it you see he frightened every one away from him when he was alive to profit us when he was dead ha ha ha spirit said scrooge shuddering from head to foot
840,i see i see
841,the case of this unhappy man might be my own
842,my life tends that way now
843,merciful heaven what is this he recoiled in terror for the scene had changed and now he almost touched a bed a bare uncurtained bed on which beneath a ragged sheet there lay a something covered up which though it was dumb announced itself in awful language
844,the room was very dark too dark to be observed with any accuracy though scrooge glanced round it in obedience to a secret impulse anxious to know what kind of room it was
845,a pale light rising in the outer air fell straight upon the bed and on it plundered and bereft unwatched unwept uncared for was the body of this man
846,scrooge glanced towards the phantom its steady hand was pointed to the head
847,the cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of it the motion of a finger upon scrooges part would have disclosed the face
848,he thought of it felt how easy it would be to do and longed to do it but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the spectre at his side
849,oh cold cold rigid dreadful death set up thine altar here and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command for this is thy dominion but of the loved revered and honoured head thou canst not turn one hair to thy dread purposes or make one feature odious
850,it is not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released it is not that the heart and pulse are still but that the hand was open generous and true the heart brave warm and tender and the pulse a mans
851,strike shadow strike and see his good deeds springing from the wound to sow the world with life immortal no voice pronounced these words in scrooges ears and yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed
852,he thought if this man could be raised up now what would be his foremost thoughts avarice harddealing griping cares they have brought him to a rich end truly he lay in the dark empty house with not a man a woman or a child to say that he was kind to me in this or that and for the memory of one kind word i will be kind to him
853,a cat was tearing at the door and there was a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearthstone
854,what they wanted in the room of death and why they were so restless and disturbed scrooge did not dare to think
855,spirit he said this is a fearful place
856,in leaving it i shall not leave its lesson trust me
857,let us go still the ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head
858,i understand you scrooge returned and i would do it if i could
859,but i have not the power spirit i have not the power again it seemed to look upon him
860,if there is any person in the town who feels emotion caused by this mans death said scrooge quite agonised show that person to me spirit i beseech you the phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment like a wing and withdrawing it revealed a room by daylight where a mother and her children were
861,she was expecting some one and with anxious eagerness for she walked up and down the room started at every sound looked out from the window glanced at the clock tried but in vain to work with her needle and could hardly bear the voices of the children in their play
862,at length the longexpected knock was heard
863,she hurried to the door and met her husband a man whose face was careworn and depressed though he was young
864,there was a remarkable expression in it now a kind of serious delight of which he felt ashamed and which he struggled to repress
865,he sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire and when she asked him faintly what news (which was not until after a long silence) he appeared embarrassed how to answer
866,is it good she said or badto help him
867,bad he answered
868,we are quite ruined no
869,there is hope yet caroline if he relents she said amazed there is nothing is past hope if such a miracle has happened he is past relenting said her husband
870,he is dead she was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke truth but she was thankful in her soul to hear it and she said so with clasped hands
871,she prayed forgiveness the next moment and was sorry but the first was the emotion of her heart
872,what the halfdrunken woman whom i told you of last night said to me when i tried to see him and obtain a weeks delay and what i thought was a mere excuse to avoid me turns out to have been quite true
873,he was not only very ill but dying then to whom will our debt be transferred i dont know
874,but before that time we shall be ready with the money and even though we were not it would be a bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his successor
875,we may sleep tonight with light hearts caroline yes soften it as they would their hearts were lighter
876,the childrens faces hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little understood were brighter and it was a happier house for this mans death the only emotion that the ghost could show him caused by the event was one of pleasure
877,let me see some tenderness connected with a death said scrooge or that dark chamber spirit which we left just now will be for ever present to me the ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet and as they went along scrooge looked here and there to find himself but nowhere was he to be seen
878,they entered poor bob cratchits house the dwelling he had visited before and found the mother and the children seated round the fire
879,quiet very quiet
880,the noisy little cratchits were as still as statues in one corner and sat looking up at peter who had a book before him
881,the mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing
882,but surely they were very quiet and he took a child and set him in the midst of them where had scrooge heard those words he had not dreamed them
883,the boy must have read them out as he and the spirit crossed the threshold
884,why did he not go on the mother laid her work upon the table and put her hand up to her face
885,the colour hurts my eyes she said
886,the colour ah poor tiny tim theyre better now again said cratchits wife
887,it makes them weak by candlelight and i wouldnt show weak eyes to your father when he comes home for the world
888,it must be near his time past it rather peter answered shutting up his book
889,but i think he has walked a little slower than he used these few last evenings mother they were very quiet again
890,at last she said and in a steady cheerful voice that only faltered once i have known him walk withi have known him walk with tiny tim upon his shoulder very fast indeed and so have i cried peter often and so have i exclaimed another
891,so had all
892,but he was very light to carry she resumed intent upon her work and his father loved him so that it was no trouble no trouble
893,and there is your father at the door she hurried out to meet him and little bob in his comforter he had need of it poor fellowcame in
894,his tea was ready for him on the hob and they all tried who should help him to it most
895,then the two young cratchits got upon his knees and laid each child a little cheek against his face as if they said dont mind it father
896,dont be grieved bob was very cheerful with them and spoke pleasantly to all the family
897,he looked at the work upon the table and praised the industry and speed of mrs cratchit and the girls
898,they would be done long before sunday he said
899,sunday you went today then robert said his wife
900,yes my dear returned bob i wish you could have gone
901,it would have done you good to see how green a place it is
902,but youll see it often
903,i promised him that i would walk there on a sunday my little little child cried bob my little child he broke down all at once
904,he couldnt help it
905,if he could have helped it he and his child would have been farther apart perhaps than they were
906,he left the room and went upstairs into the room above which was lighted cheerfully and hung with christmas there was a chair set close beside the child and there were signs of some one having been there lately
907,poor bob sat down in it and when he had thought a little and composed himself he kissed the little face
908,he was reconciled to what had happened and went down again quite happy
909,they drew about the fire and talked the girls and mother working still
910,bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of mr scrooges nephew whom he had scarcely seen but once and who meeting him in the street that day and seeing that he looked a littlejust a little down you know said bob inquired what had happened to distress him
911,on which said bob for he is the pleasantestspoken gentleman you ever heard i told him
912,i am heartily sorry for it mr cratchit he said and heartily sorry for your good wife by the bye how he ever knew that i dont know knew what my dear why that you were a good wife replied bob everybody knows that said peter very well observed my boy cried bob i hope they do
913,heartily sorry he said for your good wife
914,if i can be of service to you in any way he said giving me his card thats where i live
915,pray come to me now it wasnt cried bob for the sake of anything he might be able to do for us so much as for his kind way that this was quite delightful
916,it really seemed as if he had known our tiny tim and felt with us im sure hes a good soul said mrs cratchit you would be surer of it my dear returned bob if you saw and spoke to him
917,i shouldnt be at all surprised mark what i sayif he got peter a better situation only hear that peter said mrs cratchit and then cried one of the girls peter will be keeping company with some one and setting up for himself get along with you retorted peter grinning
918,its just as likely as not said bob one of these days though theres plenty of time for that my dear
919,but however and whenever we part from one another i am sure we shall none of us forget poor tiny timshall weor this first parting that there was among us never father cried they all
920,and i know said bob i know my dears that when we recollect how patient and how mild he was although he was a little little child we shall not quarrel easily among ourselves and forget poor tiny tim in doing it no never father they all cried again
921,i am very happy said little bob i am very happy mrs cratchit kissed him his daughters kissed him the two young cratchits kissed him and peter and himself shook hands
922,spirit of tiny tim thy childish essence was from god spectre said scrooge something informs me that our parting moment is at hand
923,i know it but i know not how
924,tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead the ghost of christmas yet to come conveyed him as beforethough at a different time he thought indeed there seemed no order in these latter visions save that they were in the futureinto the resorts of business men but showed him not himself
925,indeed the spirit did not stay for anything but went straight on as to the end just now desired until besought by scrooge to tarry for a moment
926,this court said scrooge through which we hurry now is where my place of occupation is and has been for a length of time
927,i see the house
928,let me behold what i shall be in days to come the spirit stopped the hand was pointed elsewhere
929,the house is yonder scrooge exclaimed
930,why do you point away the inexorable finger underwent no change
931,scrooge hastened to the window of his office and looked in
932,it was an office still but not his
933,the furniture was not the same and the figure in the chair was not himself
934,the phantom pointed as before
935,he joined it once again and wondering why and whither he had gone accompanied it until they reached an iron gate
936,he paused to look round before entering
937,a churchyard
938,here then the wretched man whose name he had now to learn lay underneath the ground
939,it was a worthy place
940,walled in by houses overrun by grass and weeds the growth of vegetations death not life choked up with too much burying fat with repleted appetite
941,a worthy place the spirit stood among the graves and pointed down to one he advanced towards it trembling
942,the phantom was exactly as it had been but he dreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape
943,before i draw nearer to that stone to which you point said scrooge answer me one question
944,are these the shadows of the things that will be or are they shadows of things that may be only still the ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood
945,mens courses will foreshadow certain ends to which if persevered in they must lead said scrooge but if the courses be departed from the ends will change
946,say it is thus with what you show me the spirit was immovable as ever
947,scrooge crept towards it trembling as he went and following the finger read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name ebenezer scrooge am i that man who lay upon the bed he cried upon his knees
948,the finger pointed from the grave to him and back again
949,no spirit oh no no the finger still was there
950,spirit he cried tight clutching at its robe hear me i am not the man i was
951,i will not be the man i must have been but for this intercourse
952,why show me this if i am past all hope for the first time the hand appeared to shake
953,good spirit he pursued as down upon the ground he fell before it your nature intercedes for me and pities me
954,assure me that i yet may change these shadows you have shown me by an altered life the kind hand trembled
955,i will honour christmas in my heart and try to keep it all the year
956,i will live in the past the present and the future the spirits of all three shall strive within me
957,i will not shut out the lessons that they teach
958,oh tell me i may sponge away the writing on this stone in his agony he caught the spectral hand
959,it sought to free itself but he was strong in his entreaty and detained it
960,the spirit stronger yet repulsed him
961,holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate reversed he saw an alteration in the phantoms hood and dress
962,it shrunk collapsed and dwindled down into a bedpost
963,stave v the end of it yes and the bedpost was his own
964,the bed was his own the room was his own
965,best and happiest of all the time before him was his own to make amends in i will live in the past the present and the future scrooge repeated as he scrambled out of bed
966,the spirits of all three shall strive within me
967,oh jacob marley heaven and the christmas time be praised for this i say it on my knees old jacob on my knees he was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions that his broken voice would scarcely answer to his call
968,he had been sobbing violently in his conflict with the spirit and his face was wet with tears
969,they are not torn down cried scrooge folding one of his bedcurtains in his arms they are not torn down rings and all
970,they are herei am herethe shadows of the things that would have been may be dispelled
971,they will be
972,i know they will his hands were busy with his garments all this time turning them inside out putting them on upside down tearing them mislaying them making them parties to every kind of extravagance
973,i dont know what to do cried scrooge laughing and crying in the same breath and making a perfect laocoön of himself with his stockings
974,i am as light as a feather i am as happy as an angel i am as merry as a schoolboy
975,i am as giddy as a drunken man
976,a merry christmas to everybody a happy new year to all the world
977,hallo here whoop hallo he had frisked into the sittingroom and was now standing there perfectly winded
978,theres the saucepan that the gruel was in cried scrooge starting off again and going round the fireplace
979,theres the door by which the ghost of jacob marley entered theres the corner where the ghost of christmas present sat theres the window where i saw the wandering spirits its all right its all true it all happened
980,ha ha ha really for a man who had been out of practice for so many years it was a splendid laugh a most illustrious laugh
981,the father of a long long line of brilliant laughs i dont know what day of the month it is said scrooge i dont know how long ive been among the spirits i dont know anything
982,im quite a baby
983,never mind
984,i dont care
985,id rather be a baby
986,hallo whoop hallo here he was checked in his transports by the churches ringing out the lustiest peals he had ever heard
987,clash clang hammer ding dong bell
988,bell dong ding hammer clang clash oh glorious glorious running to the window he opened it and put out his head
989,no fog no mist clear bright jovial stirring cold cold piping for the blood to dance to golden sunlight heavenly sky sweet fresh air merry bells
990,oh glorious glorious whats today cried scrooge calling downward to a boy in sunday clothes who perhaps had loitered in to look about him
991,eh returned the boy with all his might of wonder
992,whats today my fine fellow said scrooge today replied the boy
993,why christmas day its christmas day said scrooge to himself
994,i havent missed it
995,the spirits have done it all in one night
996,they can do anything they like
997,of course they can
998,of course they can
999,hallo my fine fellow hallo returned the boy
1000,do you know the poulterers in the next street but one at the corner scrooge inquired
1001,i should hope i did replied the lad
1002,an intelligent boy said scrooge a remarkable boy do you know whether theyve sold the prize turkey that was hanging up therenot the little prize turkey the big one what the one as big as me returned the boy
1003,what a delightful boy said scrooge its a pleasure to talk to him
1004,yes my buck its hanging there now replied the boy
1005,is it said scrooge go and buy it walker exclaimed the boy
1006,no no said scrooge i am in earnest
1007,go and buy it and tell em to bring it here that i may give them the direction where to take it
1008,come back with the man and ill give you a shilling
1009,come back with him in less than five minutes and ill give you halfacrown the boy was off like a shot
1010,he must have had a steady hand at a trigger who could have got a shot off half so fast
1011,ill send it to bob cratchits whispered scrooge rubbing his hands and splitting with a laugh
1012,he shant know who sends it
1013,its twice the size of tiny tim joe miller never made such a joke as sending it to bobs will be the hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady one but write it he did somehow and went downstairs to open the street door ready for the coming of the poulterers man
1014,as he stood there waiting his arrival the knocker caught his eye
1015,i shall love it as long as i live cried scrooge patting it with his hand
1016,i scarcely ever looked at it before
1017,what an honest expression it has in its face its a wonderful knockerheres the turkey hallo whoop how are you merry christmas it was a turkey he never could have stood upon his legs that bird
1018,he would have snapped em short off in a minute like sticks of sealingwax
1019,why its impossible to carry that to camden town said scrooge you must have a cab the chuckle with which he said this and the chuckle with which he paid for the turkey and the chuckle with which he paid for the cab and the chuckle with which he recompensed the boy were only to be exceeded by the chuckle with which he sat down breathless in his chair again and chuckled till he cried
1020,shaving was not an easy task for his hand continued to shake very much and shaving requires attention even when you dont dance while you are at it
1021,but if he had cut the end of his nose off he would have put a piece of stickingplaister over it and been quite satisfied
1022,he dressed himself all in his best and at last got out into the streets
1023,the people were by this time pouring forth as he had seen them with the ghost of christmas present and walking with his hands behind him scrooge regarded every one with a delighted smile
1024,he looked so irresistibly pleasant in a word that three or four goodhumoured fellows said good morning sir a merry christmas to you and scrooge said often afterwards that of all the blithe sounds he had ever heard those were the blithest in his ears
1025,he had not gone far when coming on towards him he beheld the portly gentleman who had walked into his countinghouse the day before and said scrooge and marleys i believe it sent a pang across his heart to think how this old gentleman would look upon him when they met but he knew what path lay straight before him and he took it
1026,my dear sir said scrooge quickening his pace and taking the old gentleman by both his hands
1027,how do you do i hope you succeeded yesterday
1028,it was very kind of you
1029,a merry christmas to you sir mr
1030,scrooge yes said scrooge that is my name and i fear it may not be pleasant to you
1031,allow me to ask your pardon
1032,and will you have the goodnesshere scrooge whispered in his ear
1033,lord bless me cried the gentleman as if his breath were taken away
1034,my dear mr scrooge are you serious if you please said scrooge not a farthing less
1035,a great many backpayments are included in it i assure you
1036,will you do me that favour my dear sir said the other shaking hands with him
1037,i dont know what to say to such munifi dont say anything please retorted scrooge come and see me
1038,will you come and see me i will cried the old gentleman
1039,and it was clear he meant to do it
1040,thankee said scrooge i am much obliged to you
1041,i thank you fifty times
1042,bless you he went to church and walked about the streets and watched the people hurrying to and fro and patted children on the head and questioned beggars and looked down into the kitchens of houses and up to the windows and found that everything could yield him pleasure
1043,he had never dreamed that any walkthat anythingcould give him so much happiness
1044,in the afternoon he turned his steps towards his nephews house
1045,he passed the door a dozen times before he had the courage to go up and knock
1046,but he made a dash and did it is your master at home my dear said scrooge to the girl
1047,nice girl very yes sir where is he my love said scrooge hes in the diningroom sir along with mistress
1048,ill show you upstairs if you please thankee
1049,he knows me said scrooge with his hand already on the diningroom lock
1050,ill go in here my dear he turned it gently and sidled his face in round the door
1051,they were looking at the table (which was spread out in great array) for these young housekeepers are always nervous on such points and like to see that everything is right
1052,fred said scrooge dear heart alive how his niece by marriage started scrooge had forgotten for the moment about her sitting in the corner with the footstool or he wouldnt have done it on any account
1053,why bless my soul cried fred whos that its i your uncle scrooge i have come to dinner
1054,will you let me in fred let him in it is a mercy he didnt shake his arm off
1055,he was at home in five minutes
1056,nothing could be heartier
1057,his niece looked just the same
1058,so did topper when he came
1059,so did the plump sister when she came
1060,so did every one when they came
1061,wonderful party wonderful games wonderful unanimity wonderful happiness but he was early at the office next morning
1062,oh he was early there
1063,if he could only be there first and catch bob cratchit coming late that was the thing he had set his heart upon
1064,and he did it yes he did the clock struck nine
1065,no bob a quarter past
1066,no bob he was full eighteen minutes and a half behind his time
1067,scrooge sat with his door wide open that he might see him come into the tank his hat was off before he opened the door his comforter too
1068,he was on his stool in a jiffy driving away with his pen as if he were trying to overtake nine oclock
1069,hallo growled scrooge in his accustomed voice as near as he could feign it
1070,what do you mean by coming here at this time of day i am very sorry sir said bob i am behind my time you are repeated scrooge yes
1071,i think you are
1072,step this way sir if you please its only once a year sir pleaded bob appearing from the tank it shall not be repeated
1073,i was making rather merry yesterday sir now ill tell you what my friend said scrooge i am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer
1074,and therefore he continued leaping from his stool and giving bob such a dig in the waistcoat that he staggered back into the tank again and therefore i am about to raise your salary bob trembled and got a little nearer to the ruler
1075,he had a momentary idea of knocking scrooge down with it holding him and calling to the people in the court for help and a straitwaistcoat
1076,a merry christmas bob said scrooge with an earnestness that could not be mistaken as he clapped him on the back
1077,a merrier christmas bob my good fellow than i have given you for many a year ill raise your salary and endeavour to assist your struggling family and we will discuss your affairs this very afternoon over a christmas bowl of smoking bishop bob make up the fires and buy another coalscuttle before you dot another i bob cratchit scrooge was better than his word
1078,he did it all and infinitely more and to tiny tim who did not die he was a second father
1079,he became as good a friend as good a master and as good a man as the good old city knew or any other good old city town or borough in the good old world
1080,some people laughed to see the alteration in him but he let them laugh and little heeded them for he was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe for good at which some people did not have their fill of laughter in the outset and knowing that such as these would be blind anyway he thought it quite as well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins as have the malady in less attractive forms
1081,his own heart laughed and that was quite enough for him
1082,he had no further intercourse with spirits but lived upon the total abstinence principle ever afterwards and it was always said of him that he knew how to keep christmas well if any man alive possessed the knowledge
1083,may that be truly said of us and all of us and so as tiny tim observed god bless us every one
